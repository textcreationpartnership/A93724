            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two ranks of men extremely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in regard of their eſtate and condition, that uſe for the moſt part to go with ſtaves in their hands; but not to the ſame end, or
<pb facs="tcp:115728:4"/> purpoſe. The <hi>Nobleman</hi> carries his as a badge and embleme of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and high honour. It being an ancient cuſtome for Princes to give the inveſtiture into places of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eminency, <hi>per traditionem ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi> by the delivering of a ſtaffe. The common traveller takes up his, the better to ſupport him in the length of his journey, and to eaſe him in the difficulty and roughneſſe of the way. But theſe ſtaves of Honour God hath cut aſunder, as he did thoſe of <hi>beauty,</hi> and bands, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 7. having had for theſe late years a ſharp conteſt with the <hi>Cedars</hi> of the Land. And which is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation; hath dried up the roots from whence they ſprang.</p>
            <p>That which I preſume to put into your Honours hand, is the ſtaffe
<pb facs="tcp:115728:4"/> of a traveller, yet not of ſuch an one, as beats the common rode and path of the world; but of ſuch who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves ſtrangers and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers on earth, both ſeek, and minde an heavenly countrey. And to be amongſt the number of thoſe (I am perſwaded) you do not only count it your duty; but alſo make it your work, eſteeming it a greater glory to be one of <hi>Zions</hi> Pilgrims, then of <hi>Englands</hi> Peers. Now how expedient and neceſſary a ſtaffe is in this journey, I would the times themſelvs did not abundantly ſpeak; the difficulties of which have beene ſuch; as that to many Religion it ſelf hath become a ſtone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a rock of offence. Others as dejected, have fainted in their profeſſion, and have caſt away their confidence, for want of looking
<pb facs="tcp:115728:5"/> up unto the promiſes, which in ſuch ſeaſons are the belevers only ſupport and aſſurance, that though the way, of the Lamb, be a way of blood, yet the end is a throne of glory, and a crown of life. That I may therefore ſtrengthen your hands in God, and be ſerviceable to your faith, I have) made bold to dedicate this ſmall Treatiſe of the Promiſes to your Honour, which I wiſh might prove in your hands as the rod of <hi>Myrtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the hand of the traveller, which as Hiſtorians report, doth keep him from growing weary. And that it might ſo tend to the encreaſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength, as that when the youths ſhall faint, and the young men urterly fall; you may be as thoſe that wait upon God, that run and are not weary, and walk, and are not faint, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 31. However, though
<pb facs="tcp:115728:5"/> I can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate no vertue unto it; yet I ſhal not ceaſe to follow it with my prayers, beſeeching God, that both it, and all other means which through his grace you may enjoy for the welfare of your ſoul, may prove ſo ſucceſſeful by his bleſſings, as that you may reap the rich fruit of all the Promiſes in the everlaſting fruition of life, and glory; And that your Noble poſterity may be heirs alſo together with your ſelf, of the ſame mercies. So I teſt,</p>

But farre be it from me to make the profitable paines of thoſe who have employed their time, and buſied their thoughts on ſuch a Noble ſubject as the Promiſes are, to ſerve as a dark ſhadow to ſet off this ſmall Treatiſe concerning them, which I now put into thy hands. I have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both light and profit from them, and therefore cannot but thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. Nor do I conceive that I have compriſed the great worth of the Promiſes, in this Manual, as he of old did <hi>Homers Iliads</hi> in a Nut-ſhell; or to have done ought that may be a barre to the labours of others whoſe abilities are greater, and more fit to come under a publike view then mine are. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115728:14"/> whom he rankes into Children, Young men, and Fathers. Into <hi>Children</hi> for their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe, into <hi>Young men</hi> for their ſtrength and confidence, into <hi>Fathers</hi> for their knoweledge and experience in the high myſteries of the Goſpel. All which though differing in regard of their condition, do yet agree in the principle from whence their life is derived, and in the meanes by which it is carried on and preſerved. The principle of every beleevers life is Chriſt, and the means of its preſervation are the promiſes; whoſe vertue and efficacy is ſuch, as happily ſuites it ſelf with the ſeveral age and condition of beleevers. The promiſes are the babes <hi>milk</hi> by which they are nouriſhed, the full <hi>breaſts</hi> from whence they ſuck both grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: they are the young mens <hi>evidences,</hi> by which they are animated to combat with the wicked one, and aſſured of being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with victory over him: they are the old mens <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> upon the top of which like aged <hi>Jacob</hi> they may ſafely leane, and worſhip God; it being a ſtaffe for power like <hi>Moſes</hi> rod, and for flouriſhing like <hi>Aarons,</hi> budding, bloſſoming, and yielding precious fruit. So that it is of more then ordinary concernment unto every one of them that look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115728:14"/> as beleevers (whatſoever pitch and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they have arrived unto) not to be ſupine and careleſs in the frequent uſe, and due appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the promiſes; which from their implantation into Chriſt to their full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, are the chief aides and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, both of life and growth. Nor to be like unskilful Lapidaries little valuing the worth of ſuch oriental pearles, which are the only riches and treaſure of every heir of glory on this ſide heaven. Concerning which this verſe holds forth ſundry weighty particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; branching it ſelf out into as many parts, as that river which went out of <hi>Eden</hi> to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the garden, from whence it was parted and became into foure heads, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the fountaine from whence the promiſes flow; to which (if we read the words <hi>per quem, by whom</hi>) the relative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle fairly guideth us; as a ſtanding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie doth the doubtfull traveller.

To him they were all firſt made, and ratified on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; in him they are all fulfilled and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed unto us. As the rivers have their <hi>efflux</hi> from the ſea, and their <hi>reflux</hi> into the ſea; ſo have the promiſes their <hi>emanation</hi> from Chriſt, their <hi>revolution</hi> into Chriſt; they <hi>flow</hi> freely from him, they <hi>lead</hi> ſweetly to him.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115728:15"/>
               <p>The ſecond branch is the <hi>tenure,</hi> and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of intereſt that beleevers have in the promiſes: They <hi>are given unto us.</hi> In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of language, promiſes are rather made then given; but by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> uſuall in Scripture they are put for the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the bleſſings both of grace and glory. All which though purchaſed by Chriſt with the price of his blood; are yet conferred, and freely beſtowed upon beleevers by his mercy. The <hi>hidden Manna,</hi> a type of our heavenly conſolations, the <hi>White stone,</hi> the embleme of our perfect juſtification, the <hi>New name,</hi> the earneſt of our adoption in glory, they are favours not ſet to ſale, but given, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. Out of the full heap Chriſt invites not to <hi>buy,</hi> but to <hi>take,</hi> and the penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe are the moſt welcome, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia gratis datur, etiam cùm emitur, gratis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur:</hi> Grace (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi>) is freely given, yea when it is bought, it is bought freely and without price.</p>
               <p>The third is the <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of the promiſes, ſet forth by a double character: <hi>Exceeding great, and precious.</hi> Greatneſſe and goodneſſe are then moſt refulgent when they meet in the ſame ſubject, and are joyned by natural couples and connexions;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115728:16"/> like to the curtaines of the Tabernacle, that were looped one to another; but ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction as it is glorious, ſo it is rare, and ſeldome found either in <hi>perſons,</hi> or in <hi>things,</hi> in perſons they are ſo diſſociated, as if they were of lineages altogether diſtinct, and had ſmall or no affinity. Rarely are great men good, or good men great. And as in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo in things they are not often linked, and chained together. <hi>Pibbles</hi> are great, but not precious; <hi>Pearles</hi> are precious, but not great; water in the <hi>ſea</hi> is <hi>abundant,</hi> but not <hi>pure;</hi> in the brook <hi>pure,</hi> but not <hi>abundant.</hi> But in the promiſes there is a full and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concurrence of both, they are made up of things wherein greatneſſe and worth do vie with each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> everlaſting life is as ſweet, as long; heaven is as glorious in its beauty, as vaſt in its dimenſions; the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that is laid up is as <hi>rich</hi> as <hi>weighty.</hi> There is no one promiſe of the Goſpel, but is of that extent for its latitude, and of that value for its preciouſneſſe, that he deſerves to be eternally poore, who having that for his ſubſiſtence, looks upon any man who hath an intereſt in none, greater or richer then himſelf though the gravel of the river were turned into pearles, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115728:16"/> every ſhowre of raine from the clouds into a ſhowre of ſilver and gold for to ſupply his wants.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular is, The high and noble end of the donation of the promiſes. <hi>That by them we might be partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, &amp;c.</hi> Painters when they picture Angels, do not intend <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> but <hi>beauty:</hi> Nor doth the Apoſtle in this expreſſion aime at any eſſential change, and converſion of our ſubſtance into the nature of God, and Chriſt; but only at the elevation and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of our nature by Chriſt. Our neer union with him doth reſtore us to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſimilitude and likeneſſe of God, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we attained in our primitive perfection; but it doth not introduce any reall tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation either of our bodies or ſouls into the divine nature. For if that ſtupendious uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two natures in one perſon the Lord Chriſt, doth not effect an eſſential change in either; but that both natures do conſerve, and retaine their diſtinct properties without mixture, or confuſion: much leſſe can the Union between Chriſt and beleevers, which is not <hi>a perſonal Union,</hi> but an <hi>Union of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> made by the Spirit, and by faith, cauſe any ſuch alteration; as that our nature lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115728:17"/> its own ſubſiſtence, ſhould wholly paſſe into the divine, and be ſwallowed up in the Abyſſe of it; as a drop when it falls into the wide Ocean. Pithily doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this truth, when he affirmes, <hi>Nostra &amp; ipſius conjunctio nec miſcet perſonas, nec unit ſubſtantias; ſed affectus conſociat, &amp; confoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dérat voluntates:</hi> Our and Chriſts conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth neither mingle perſons, nor unite ſubſtances; but doth conjoyne our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bring into a league of amity our wills. Suitable to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. They that are joyned to the Lord, are made one ſpirit.</hi>

               <p>IT is not deſigned by me as the ſubject of my preſent task to undertake a diſtinct and full proſecution of all theſe foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the text, every one of which like gold in the beating, would eaſily diffuſe and ſpread themſelves into a large compaſſe; but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115728:17"/> occaſionally to glance at them, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the illuſtration of that head, and branch which I ſhall ſingle and cull out from the reſt, as the preſent ſubject upon which I ſhall pitch and fix my thoughts, and that is the matchleſſe worth and goodneſſe of the promiſes of the Goſpel. A truth it is of much weight, and ſweetneſſe to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever; but yet as it lies contracted in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, diſcovers not ſo much of it; as when drawn forth into a full explication: like to colours that are leſſe beautiful and pleaſing, while they lie on the <hi>palate</hi> of the painter, then when placed and ſpread on the <hi>picture</hi> by the pencil of the artificer. I ſhall therefore in the unfolding of it endeavour theſe five things.</p>

                  <item>Fourthly, reſolve ſome uſefull Queries and caſes concerning them.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, cloſe and ſhut up all with ſome practicall inferences and genuine applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as flow from the doctrine of the promiſes; The honey, which drops from the

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, what a promiſe is. It is a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods will, wherein he ſignifies what particular good things he will freely beſtow, and the evils that he will remove. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription like the box of ſpiknard in the Goſpel may be more uſefull when it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, then whole: <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore take it into pieces, and give an account of it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parcels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a promiſe is a declaration of Gods will: it being a kinde of middle thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his purpoſe, and performance, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of good, and the execution of it upon thoſe whom he loveth. And as wicked <hi>Jezabel, 1 King.</hi> 19. 2.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not ſatisfie her hatred of <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, in intending evil unto him, and effecting it upon him in time, as ſhe could; but withal ſhe lets fall an heavy threatning againſt him, ſtrengthened with a bitter imprecation upon her ſelf, as an obliging tie to put in execution the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned evil: <hi>So let the gods do to me, and more alſo; if I make not thy life, as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</hi> So much leſſe can the love of God ſatisfie it ſelf in a gracious decree, and purpoſe of good towards his elect ſhut up in his own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115728:18"/> breaſt, and the actual performance of it in the fulneſſe of time; unleſſe withal he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it unto them before-hand, both as a ground of preſent comfort in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and of hope and expectation in the certain enjoyment of the good things promiſed hereafter: God alſo confirming the word of his truth by an oath; not for any neceſſity or weakneſſe in its ſelfe; but out of ſuperabundant love unto the heires of promiſe; <hi>That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, they might have a ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a declaration <hi>concerning good.</hi> And thereby a promiſe is differenced from the threatnings of God, which in divers reſpects have a neere affinity with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. For they, as things of a middle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do intervene between the decree of his wrath, and the execution of it: they are let fall in the Word as ſo many diſcoveries of Gods anger againſt ſinne, and ſet as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtops to check and bound the luſts of ſinners, who are apt to daſh themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rock of divine diſpleaſure: they are ſealed with the ſame oath of God, with which the promiſes are ratified; that ſo they might be as full of dread to ſinners, in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115728:19"/> expectation of the fulfilling of them; as the promiſes are of comfort to Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is concerning good things free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed. And thereby it is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>commands,</hi> which are alſo ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Gods will concerning good; but it is of the good of <hi>duty</hi> enjoyned to be done, not of the good of <hi>mercy</hi> to be received. The <hi>precepts</hi> of God, and the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, they alwayes go together in the Word, as the <hi>veines</hi> and the arteries do in the body; wherever there goes a veine that carries <hi>blood,</hi> there alſo accompanies it an artery that carries <hi>ſpirits:</hi> ſo wherever there is a precept in the Word that enjoynes <hi>duty,</hi> there alſo is an anſwerable promiſe that aſſures <hi>comfort:</hi> the one holding forth the good to be done, the other the good to be received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is of particular good things. And this may ſerve to hint, and point out one conſiderable difference between the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace,</hi> and the <hi>promiſes.</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that is as the entire <hi>Vintage</hi> of the heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> And the promiſes they are as the ſeverall <hi>cluſters</hi> of bleſſing: that is, as a glorious <hi>conſtellation</hi> of many celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bodies in the firmament of the Scriptures;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115728:19"/> and they are as ſo many ſingle <hi>ſtars</hi> ſhining in their proper orbes: that is, as the <hi>totall ſumme</hi> in the Inventory of a beleevers eſtate; and they are as the diſtinct <hi>particulars</hi> which make it up. All the <hi>ſweetneſſe, beauty, worth</hi> that are diffuſed throughout the promiſes, are collected in the Covenant; as the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered light in the creation was into the body of the Sun. Gods Stipulation of becoming ours, and of making us to be his, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. comprizeth every thing that is deſirable, from the <hi>firſt</hi> of goods, to the <hi>laſt:</hi> and is both the <hi>baſis</hi> and the <hi>ſpire:</hi> the <hi>corner-ſtone</hi> and the <hi>top-ſtone</hi> of every Chriſtians happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, is added [<hi>the evils that he will remove.</hi>] And this takes in all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative mercies and bleſſings, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel do hold forth to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: which though they be not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent part of their happineſſe; are yet of ſo neceſſary a concurrence unto it; as that without them, it can never be abſolute or entire. True happineſſe conſiſts of a double branch, of an <hi>immunity,</hi> or freedome from evils, and the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of good; both which are tacitly couched in every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but in many moſt expreſly and fully
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115728:20"/> ſet down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. to them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, <hi>the Lord God is a Sun, and a ſhield, &amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Sun</hi> to give life, and a <hi>ſhield</hi> to preſerve life given. A <hi>Sun</hi> to make fruitful in all good, and a ſhield to protect from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6, 7 8. the felicity of the Church is deſcribed by <hi>a feaſt of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined,</hi> that the Lord will make unto his people in mount <hi>Zion:</hi> but to render theſe dainties the more pleaſing, he promiſeth alſo; <hi>To take away the face of the covering, to ſwallow up death in victory, to wipe away all tears from their eyes.</hi> Blindneſſe that may hinder the clear <hi>knowledge,</hi> death that may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the <hi>perpetuity, ſorrow</hi> that may diminiſh the <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> of this bleſſed eſtate, ſhall all by a powerful hand be removed, and done away.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the promiſes do derive a preciouſneſs from the root and principle from whence they ſpring: They are as ſo many <hi>beames of Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> and do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part a light, which diſcovers his excellency, evidenceth our propriety, and effecteth in us a bleſſed purity. They are the <hi>deſirable fruit of the tree of life;</hi> not of that tree of life in the beginning of the Bible, which ſtood in <hi>Adams</hi> Paradiſe on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of that in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115728:21"/> end of the Bible, in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Paradiſe in heaven; not of that which was guarded with <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and <hi>a flaming ſword,</hi> that it might not be touched; but of that in the midſt of <hi>the City of God,</hi> free for every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever to put forth the hand of faith, and to take and eat of the fruit of it, both as <hi>food</hi> and <hi>medicine.</hi> They are <hi>the cryſtal ſtreams of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> river of life which proceeded out of the Throne of God, and the Lamb,</hi> Revel 22. 1. Whoſe waters in time of drought never fail; but with their overflowing plenty ſatisfie the thirſty, with their cooling vertue allay the heat of the wearied, and with their ſweetneſſe cheere, and revive the drooping and dejected ſpirits. And now methinks, I cannot but make a pauſe, and ſtand a while admiring both a beleevers happineſſe, and Chriſts bounty; each of which are of ſuch tranſcendency; as that they better ſuit with an holy wonderment, then with the moſt lively and full expreſſions. Oh! how happy is every beleever, whoſe light is the love of Chriſt ſhining in the raies of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; whoſe food is the tree of life, that continually yields fruit both <hi>new</hi> and <hi>various!</hi> whoſe cordials are the waters of life, not ſparingly given to a bare ſuſtentation, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115728:21"/> freely flowing to a delightful ſatiety! Well might <hi>David</hi> in a rapture ſay, Lord! <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him! and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him! for thou haſt made him a little lower then the Angels,</hi> Pſal. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5.

                     <hi>SECT. 2.</hi> The promiſes the root of Faith.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, the promiſes may be ſaid to be great and precious, in reſpect of that proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and peculiar relation which they have to the moſt excellent and noble grace of faith, above all other graces whatſoever. They are the precious objects of precious faith, as the Apoſtle ſtiles it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115728:22"/> True it is, that the quickening influence and vertue of the promiſes doth reach every grace of the Spirit, whereby they are both facilitated and ſtrengthened in their ſeveral motions and operations: by them <hi>hope</hi> is kept alive in its expectation of Good, <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is ſupported under difficulties, <hi>holineſſe</hi> is perfected, <hi>love</hi> is inflamed, and a bleſſed <hi>feare</hi> of God is preſerved. But yet all this is not done by the immediate intercourſe which theſe graces have with the promiſes; but by the intervention of faith, which firſt feeds upon them as the <hi>Manna</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and then communicates the ſweetneſs and vertue that it draws and receives from them in a ſuitable manner to every other grace. As the root firſt ſucks the juyce and ſap from the earth of which it makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and then ſends forth a digeſted nouriſhment unto the ſeveral branches, and fruit that hangs upon the tree: ſo doth the <hi>radical</hi> grace of faith diſtribute to other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſtrength and life, which it is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>promiſes.</hi> And as the concoction that faith makes, is more or leſſe perfect; ſo are the operations of every grace the more or leſſe vigorous. Faith is a kinde of <hi>mediatour</hi> between Chriſt and all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115728:22"/> our graces, as Chriſt is between us and God. As we have nothing from God, but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by and through Chriſt: So no grace is partaker of any vertue and influence from Chriſt, but by the mediation, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of faith.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the promiſes are exceeding great and precious, in reſpect of the remarkable worth and value of thoſe things, in which they intereſt beleevers, and give them a right unto by an unqueſtionable claime and title. It is a full and weighty obſervation (of which <hi>Grotius</hi> hath afforded two parts) that there are three things which do clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and highly alſo commend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel above any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whatever. <hi>The certainty of principles of truſt, the ſanctity of precepts, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of rewards.</hi> What religion is there amongſt that multiplicity which have found entertainment in the world, wherein God is repreſented to the ſoul ſo meet and fit an object of truſt, as in the Goſpel? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being there made acceſſible by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115728:23"/> of goodneſſe; and God and man who were at a diſtance, ſo neerely united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, as that it is impoſſible to be determined whether be the greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the <hi>myſtery</hi> or the <hi>mercy.</hi> Where are there in any religion ſuch exact precepts of holineſſe enjoyned, as in the Goſpel? which lay a law upon every motion of the ſoul, and become either a rule to guide it, or a Judge to cenſure it. Or where by ſearch do we finde ſuch ample and full rewards, as may match and parallel the rewards of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to beleevers? There we read of the bread of life for food, of the waters of life for pleaſure and delight, of a crown of life for honour, of an inheritance in life for riches, of a weight of glory for cloathing and beauty. All which are not mentioned in the Word, as in a bare and naked <hi>declaratory,</hi> which conveighs nothing of title or intereſt, and ſpeaks rather the <hi>perfection</hi> of heaven, then the <hi>happineſſe</hi> of beleevers; but are ſet down and ſpecified in the promiſes, which as they declare a goodneſſe and excellency in things, do alſo give a right and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto perſons in them: they being in the matters of God, as deeds and evidences are in the matters of men; which when they are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115728:23"/> ſigned, ſealed, witneſſed, and delivered, do inveſt men in a juſt and legal right of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is mentioned, and contained in them. All that a beleever hath to plead, or to ſhew for that eſtate of glory of which he is an heir, is the promiſe. Eternal <hi>life</hi> is by promiſe, 1 <hi>John 2. 25. This is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life.</hi> The <hi>crown</hi> is by promiſe, <hi>Jam. 1. 12.

               <p>FOurthly, the promiſes of the Goſpel are exceeding great and precious, in regard of that high and noble effect which they work in beleevers; who by the energie and powerful operation of the promiſes, are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the utmoſt pitch both of perfection, and bleſſedneſſe in their being and eſtate, being by them <hi>made partakers of the divine nature,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us: Not by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſhare, and partnerſhip in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence of God, and thereby to become <hi>drops, beames, particles</hi> of the Deity, as ſome have moſt fondly dreamed: But by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115728:24"/> a participation of divine qualities and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, whereby beleevers are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto God; having thoſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in the holy nature of God, and Chriſt by way of <hi>eminency,</hi> to be <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>ſecundùm modum creaturae,</hi> imprinted and ſtamped on their ſouls, ſo farre as the image of his infinite holineſſe is expreſſible in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and reſtrained being. As the wax when it doth receive an impreſſion from the ſeale, doth not participate of the eſſence of the ſeale, but only receives a ſignature and ſtamp made upon it: ſo when God leaves a character and print of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or other excellencies upon the ſoule, he doth not communicate any thing of his ſubſtance or eſſence, but effecteth only a reſemblance in the creature of thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are truly in himſelfe, which being originally, and totally derived from him, may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be the divine nature. In the Painters table that is called a face, or hand, which is onely the lively image or repreſentation of ſuch things to the eye: and ſo thoſe divine lineaments of beauty and holineſſe which are drawn by the finger of God upon the ſoul of believers, may be called the divine nature, as they are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115728:25"/> ſhadowy repreſentations of his own glorious being: but not as they are any particles or traduction of it. The higheſt honour that any creature can attaine unto, is to be a living picture of God; to ſhew forth as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. the vertues of God, and Chriſt: and he that raiſeth it any higher, muſt have ſwelling and lofty thoughts of the creature, and low and diſhonourable thoughts of God. Now this likeneſſe to God, or this <hi>Deiformitas, Chriſtiformitas,</hi> as the pious Ancients were wont to ſtyle it, is wrought by the promiſes.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, beleevers may be ſaid to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature by the promiſes, as they are the <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> Both which are graces that have in them a wonderful aptitude to cleanſe and purifie the Subjects in which they dwell, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce true holineſſe in which the lively image and reſemblance of God doth chiefly conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith</hi> it believes the truth of thoſe things which God hath promiſed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends alſo the worth and excellency of them to be ſuch as that thereby it is made firme and conſtant in its adherence, vigorous and active in its endeavours to uſe all means for the obtaining a conformity to God and Chriſt, and the eſcaping of the corruption that is in the world through luſt. For till a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115728:26"/> man come to be a believer he is by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Satan, and the ſpecious promiſes with which they uſually come attended, drawn aſide to the commiſſion of the worſt of ſinnes, in which though he weary himſelf to finde what firſt was ſeemingly promiſed, yet he meets with nothing but deluſions and diſappointments of his expectation. <hi>Balaam</hi> hath an edge ſet upon his ſpirit to curſe the people of God by a promiſe of preferment made unto him and he tires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in going from place to place to effect it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but God hinders him from doing of the one, and <hi>Balack</hi> denies the giving unto him the other. So <hi>Judas</hi> by a baite that ſuits his covetouſneſſe undertakes to ſell his Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when he hath accompliſhed his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and received his wages, he throws it away, and dares not keep what before he ſo earneſtly thirſted after: the blood of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter makes every piece of the ſilver look gaſtly, ſo that now he ſees another image upon it then <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and cries out that he had ſinned in betraying innocent blood. Now faith it enables a beleever to diſcern a ſnare, a defilement under all the gilded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durements of Satan and the world: And therefore he rejects with ſcorne thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115728:26"/> with which others are miſerably cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, &amp; reſiſts with reſolution all the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and ſolicitations of the fleſh, to which others yield, beholding onely a ſtability and preciouſneſſe in thoſe promiſes which have the <hi>oath</hi> of God to make them <hi>ſure,</hi> and his <hi>love</hi> to make them <hi>ſweet.</hi> And theſe only have a prevailing power with him, to cauſe him ſo to order his converſation in all manner of holineſſe, that he may walk as it becomes an heire of heaven, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted ſonne of the moſt high God to walk.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as <hi>Faith</hi> by beleeving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes doth purifie the heart; ſo alſo doth hope which expects the performance of what faith beleeveth, work and produce the ſame effects. <hi>He that hath this hope in him, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelf, even as God is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 3. The expectation which beleevers have by the promiſes, is not a ſupine oſcitancy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they look to be poſſeſſed of life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without any care or endeavours of theirs for to obtaine it: like to callow and unfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered birds, that lie in the neſt, and have all their food brought to them, gaping one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for to receive it: But it is an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on accompanied with diligence and induſtry
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115728:27"/> for the fruition of what they do expect. <hi>The grace of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,) teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. And the ground of this he ſubjoyneth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Looking for that bleſsed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He that truly expects glory, earneſtly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. He that hopes to be with God in heaven, uſeth all meanes to be like God on earth. An heavenly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the natural fruit of an heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Heathen could ſay that labour was the husband of hope. There is hope the <hi>harlot,</hi> and hope the <hi>wife.</hi> Hope the <hi>married woman</hi> is known from hope the <hi>harlot</hi> by this, that ſhe alwayes accompanieth with her husbands labour. True hope looks to enjoy nothing but what is gotten by travel and paines, and therefore uſeth all meanes to obtaine that good which faith apprehendeth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: It ſeekes glory by grace, it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after communion with God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by working a conformity to God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115728:27"/> in a beleever while he is on earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, beleevers are made partakers of the divine nature by the promiſes as they are the irreverſible <hi>obſignations</hi> and <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of God, which he hath freely made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them of his taking them unto himſelf in an everlaſting communion of life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Heaven is (as <hi>Proſper</hi> calls it,) <hi>Regio bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinis,</hi> the onely climate where bleſſedneſſe dwells in its perfection. While we are here below, we are but as Kings in the cradle: the throne on which we muſt ſit, the robes with which we muſt be clothed, the crown which muſt be ſet upon our heads, are all reſerved for heaven. In this life there is onely a taſte of celeſtial delights, and in the other there is a perpetual <hi>feaſt.</hi> Here <hi>we ſee through a glaſſe darkly; but then face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. Grace doth as <hi>Cameron</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>adſignificare infirmitatem,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notate a weakneſſe and imperfection; and glory that ſignifies an abolition, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away whatſoever is weak or imperfect. But all this abſolute perfection of happineſſe which is laid up in heaven for beleevers, is ratified and made ſure unto them in the promiſes; and therefore they are ſaid to be heires of the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. Yea, by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115728:28"/> the promiſes, they have the pledges and firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of all that happineſſe which they ſhall enjoy in heaven, given unto them in this life. <hi>We are now the ſonnes of God,</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>though it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be,</hi> 1 John 3. 2. That is, we now beare his image and likeneſſe, though in a more dark and imperfect character. Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our grace, our comforts are all incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: <hi>But when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him.</hi> That is, when Chriſt ſhall come to receive us unto himſelf, we ſhall beare upon us his reſemblance in a full and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner, being made one with him in an everlaſting fellowſhip of bliſſe and glory. Deſervedly therefore may the promiſes that ſeale heaven to believers in the other life, and begin it in this life, be ſaid to make them partakers of the divine nature.</p>

               <p>FIfthly, the promiſes of the Goſpel are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great and precious, in regard of thoſe ſuperlative and matchleſs conſolations which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115728:28"/> they derive unto beleevers amidſt the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and viciſſitudes that they are ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto, while they are in the body, and beare about them both the remainders of ſinne, and of death: In the ſad Winter of deſertion when the verdure of all other comforts wither, and drop like leaves that are bitten with the froſt; the promiſes, they are <hi>Roſae in hyeme,</hi> Roſes that blow in the Winter, and do with their beauty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and with their fragrancy revive the drooping and dejected ſoul. <hi>Thy Word is my comfort in my affliction,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for it hath quickened me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 50. In the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Gods diſpleaſure, with which many times the beſt of Saints are afflicted, even to the drying up of all their moiſture, they are <hi>Aeſtivae nives,</hi> the onely ſummer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnowes that coole and allay the ſcorching heat, and make that Chriſtian that was like a parched Wilderneſs to become like a watered Garden. <hi>As cold waters to a thirſty ſoul,</hi> (faith <hi>Solomon) ſo is good news from a far countrey,</hi> Prov. 25. 25. Good tydings from heaven by the Goſpel-promiſes are moſt welcome in ſuch a condition. In the tempeſtuous ſeaſons of trouble and affliction, they are the <hi>ſacrae anchorae,</hi> ſacred and ſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115728:29"/> to ſtay and fix beleevers amidſt all toſſings, &amp; to make them ride ſafely without touching upon the ſands, ſo as to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in deſpaire; or daſhing againſt the rocks, ſo as to be ſhipwrackt by preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore the Apoſtle calls them a <hi>ſure refuge</hi> to ſuch as lay hold upon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. In the calme and ſerene times of peace, they are <hi>Vela candida,</hi> the onely white ſpread ſailes, which filled with the ſweet breathings of the Spirit, do triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on believers to the faire havens of everlaſting happineſſe. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> as within Ken of the ſhore after the cuſtome of the Mariners gives a joyful and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>celeuſma</hi> or ſhout, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting?

Surely if we ſhould compare the one with the other, we might quickly finde as vaſt a difference, as between a noiſome <hi>layſtal,</hi> and a precious bed of <hi>ſpices;</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a reviving <hi>cordial,</hi> and a dangerous <hi>poyſon. Foreſtus</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De venenis,</hi> concerning poyſons, reports of a woman that had accuſtomed her body to poyſons, by making them her uſual food, that ſhe had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115728:29"/> brought her ſelf and her whole conſtitution, to be of the ſame power as the poyſon it ſelfe was; but yet retained ſo much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that ſhe allured Princes to her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements, and by that means killed and poyſoned them. Not much unlike this harlot is the world; whoſe delights and pleaſures retaine ſo much of a ſeeming beauty, as to entice many to be enamoured with them; but when they are enjoyed by thoſe that eagerly thirſt after them, they do by their deceitful embracements deſtroy and kill their lovers. There is a poyſonful and contagious breath that comes from them, which layes the foundation of a lingring and certaine death: And who is there that hath inordinately let out his heart unto them, that hath not experienced the deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which abounds in them? But that we may the better ſee how farre the comforts of the promiſes do excell the comforts of the world, let us weigh them in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance together, and we ſhall quickly finde how greatly they fall ſhort, of yielding ſuch real conſolations as freely flow from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, by a due conſideration of theſe foure particulars.</p>

Geographers</hi> in their deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of <hi>America</hi> report, that in <hi>Peru,</hi> there is a river called the <hi>Diurnal</hi> or day-river, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it runs with a great current in the day, but is wholly drie at night; which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, as they ſay, by the heat of the ſun, that in the day-time melts the ſnow that lies on the mountaines thereabouts: but when the Sunne goes down, and the cold night approacheth, the ſnow congealeth, which only fed it, and the channel is quite dried up: Not much unlike this river, are all wordly contentments, which are onely <hi>day-comforts,</hi> but not <hi>night-comforts:</hi> In the ſun-ſhine of peace and proſperity, they flow with ſome pleaſing ſtreames; but in the night ſeaſon of affliction they vaniſh and come to nothing: Then the rich man, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>vigilat in plumâ, ſuſpirat licèt bibat gemmas,</hi> lyes reſtleſſe upon a bed of downe, and fetcheth deep groans though he drink pearles, and Saphires: But it is farre otherwiſe with the promiſes, whoſe

The widow thought her ſtore of meale and oyle to be brought to ſo low an ebbe, as that it would ſerve but for one cake, which two ſticks would be fuel enough to bake, and then both ſhe and her ſon muſt expect to die; but then the Lord did put forth his power,

The like apprehenſions have the dear and beloved ones of God frequently in their afflictions, and temptations which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them; they think they have ſcarce faith enough to laſt one day more, ſcarce ſtrength enough for one prayer more, ſcarce courage enough for one conflict more, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they and their hopes muſt die, and give up the ghoſt for ever: But in the midſt of all theſe feares and miſgivings which ariſe from their hearts, there iſſueth out ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of comfort from the promiſes, which if it gives not deliverance from their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, doth effect their preſervation in them; if it overflow not to make them <hi>glad,</hi> it failes not to make them <hi>patient,</hi> and to wait, till God ſend forth judgement unto victory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20.</p>

One ſunne, when overcaſt with thick clouds which threaten to blot it out of its orbe, doth then enlighten the earth farre more, then multitudes of ſtars that ſhine bright in the cleareſt night: and ſo one promiſe in armies of changes that befall beleevers, fills their ſouls with more ſerenity and peace, then the confluence of all outward contentments can produce under one ſmall and petty croſſe. A Chriſtian many times walkes

               <p>HAving ſhew'd what a promiſe is, and the ſundry reſpects wherein the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel are precious by way of eminency and exceſſe: I paſſe on to the third general head, which is made up of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rules and directions that concern the due application of them; which are by ſo much the more neceſſary, by how much the promiſes above all other parts of the ſacred Oracles of God are moſt apt to be deeply injured by the two ſinful extremes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, and preſumption. The infirme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever whoſe jealouſies and miſgivings are too ſtrong for his faith, puts away from him the conſolations of the promiſes as ſmall,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115728:35"/> and looks upon them as cordials not ſtrong enough to heale and remove his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The over-ſecure and ſelf-confident perſon, placeth his fond preſumptions in the roome of Gods promiſe; and thereby drawes as certaine a ruine upon himſelfe, as he who ventures to go over a deep river without any other bridge then what his ſhadow makes.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore branch the rules which concerne the right uſe of them, into rules <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>cautionary:</hi> the one pointing out ſeveral duties which every one muſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe in, that would willingly reape any real fruit and advantage from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: the other forewarning the many errours and miſtakes, which are as ſtones of ſtumbling to weak Chriſtians, or as ſtones that lye upon the mouth of the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which muſt be removed before the water of comfort can be drawn from them. I ſhall begin with the poſitive rules, which are many.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, in the applying of any promiſe, fix
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115728:35"/> the eye of your faith upon God, and Chriſt in it. Promiſes are not the <hi>primary</hi> object of faith, but the <hi>ſecondary:</hi> or they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the meanes by which we believe, then the things on which we are to reſt. As in the Sacraments the elements of bread and wine ſerve as outward ſignes to bring Chriſt and a beleever together; but that which faith cloſeth with and feedeth upon, is Chriſt in the Ordinance, and not the naked elements themſelves. So the promiſes are inſtrumental in the coming of Chriſt and the ſoul together; they are the <hi>warrant</hi> by which faith is imboldned to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to him, and to take hold of him; but the union which faith makes, is not between a beleever and the promiſe, but between a beleever and Chriſt. And therefore thoſe Divines who in their Catechetical Syſtems have made the formal object of faith to be the <hi>promiſe,</hi> rather then the <hi>perſon</hi> of Chriſt, have failed in their expreſſions, if not in their intentions, and have ſpoken rather popularly then accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the object of faith is not <hi>ens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexum,</hi> an Evangelical maxim or propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but <hi>ens incomplexum,</hi> the perſon of Chriſt, as the whole current of Scripture-expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do abundantly teſtifie, wherein faith is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115728:36"/> deſcribed by <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. by <hi>beleeving</hi> on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. by <hi>coming</hi> to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 36. As we cannot come to Chriſt without the aide of a promiſe; ſo may we not reſt in the promiſe without cloſing with Chriſt. The promiſes they are but as the <hi>field,</hi> and Chriſt is the hidden <hi>pearle</hi> which is to be ſought in them; they are as the <hi>golden candleſticks,</hi> and he is both as the <hi>Olive-tree</hi> which drops fatneſſe into them, and as the light which ſhines in them; they are as the <hi>Alabaſter-box,</hi> and he is as the precious <hi>ſpicknard</hi> which ſends forth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſavour; they are as the the <hi>golden pot,</hi> and he is the <hi>Mannah</hi> which is treaſured and laid up in them; they are as the <hi>glaſse,</hi> and he is the beautifull <hi>face</hi> which is to be ſeen in them. <hi>We all beholding with open face as in a glaſse the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. But in looking unto God and Chriſt in the promiſe, let the eye of faith be directed eſpecially to theſe foure attributes and perfections of God, the <hi>freeneſſe</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> in making them, the <hi>abſoluteneſſe</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> to effect them, the <hi>unhangeableneſſe</hi> of his <hi>counſel</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, or diſannull the leaſt iota of them,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115728:36"/> the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of his <hi>wiſdome</hi> to performe all which he hath ſpoken in the beſt ſeaſon and joynt of time. Theſe are foure ſuch pillars upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which faith may ſafely leane, and which the ſtrength of the moſt violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations can never ſhake, much leſſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did the pillars of the houſe againſt which he leaned, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 30.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, view with the eye of faith the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of Gods grace in making ſo many rich promiſes: they are all <hi>patents</hi> of grace, not <hi>bills</hi> of debt; <hi>expreſsions</hi> of love, not <hi>rewards</hi> of ſervices; <hi>gifts,</hi> not wages: He that made many out of mercy, might without the leaſt umbrage of injuſtice have made none. Though his truth do tie him to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, yet his love and mercy one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did move him to the making of them: his <hi>promiſe</hi> hath made him a <hi>debtour,</hi> but free grace made him a promiſer. And here the aſſertion of the School may be judged ſound: <hi>Divina voluntas, licèt ſimpiciter libera ſit ad extra, ex ſuppoſitione tamen unius actus liberi, poteſt neceſſitari ad alterum:</hi> Though the will of God be moſt entirely free in all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115728:37"/> his manifeſtations towards the creature, yet upon the voluntary and free preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of one ſuppoſed act we may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be neceſſarily obliged to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Thus God was moſt abſolutely free in the making of his promiſes; but having made them, he is neceſſitated to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them by his truth. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. God who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie hath promiſed, before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> And that of the Prophet, <hi>Thou wilt performe the truth to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 20. The making of the promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was free mercy, the fulfilling of it to <hi>Jacob</hi> was juſtice and truth.</p>
                  <p>This direction touching the freeneſſe of Gods grace in the promiſes is exceeding uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſuccour and relieve the perplexing fears of the weak and tempted Chriſtian, who though he have eyes to ſee the unſpeakable worth and excellencie of the promiſes, yet hath not the confidence to put forth the hand of faith and to apply them to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. He wants forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, but doubts the promiſe of blotting out ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities belongs not unto him: He is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and gladly would that Chriſt might
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115728:37"/> ſpread the skirt of his righteouſneſſe over him to hide his deformities: But alas! what hath a leper to do with a royal robe? He is ſick and diſeaſed, but the Phyſick that muſt cure him, the leaſt drop of it is more worth then a world, and he is more vile then the duſt; How then can he expect, that he ſhould ever be the patient of ſuch a Phyſician, who will be both at the coſt to buy the Phyſick, and at the paines to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it? If he had an heart to love God as <hi>David,</hi> if talents to glorifie God as <hi>Paul,</hi> if he were but an Iſraelite without guile as <hi>Nathanael,</hi> then he might have hopes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, to have his perſon accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his ſervices rewarded, and his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections pardoned. But his heart with which he ſhould love God, is carnal, and not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; his talents and abilities with which he ſhould glorifie God, are few or none; his ſincerity which ſhould be the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perfection of all his duties, hath more then an ordinary tincture of hypocriſie and ſelf-ends mixed with it. With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therefore can ſuch an one draw neer to Chriſt, or ever expect to be welcomed by him? Now to put to ſilence theſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and to allay theſe feares, which unleſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115728:38"/> checkt and bounded, do oftentimes termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the blackneſſe of deſpaire; there is not a more effectual remedy, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the freeneſſe of the grace of God and Chriſt in the promiſes, which are not made to ſuch as <hi>deſerve</hi> mercy, but to ſuch as <hi>want</hi> it; not to righteous perſons, but to ſinners; not to the whole, but to the ſick. And therefore ſuch who through the weakneſſe of faith, or the violence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations finde it difficult to lay hold on the promiſes of God touching the pardon of ſin, and the obtaining of life and ſalvation, let them reſolve the promiſes into the firſt root and principle from whence they ſpring, which is not from any <hi>good</hi> within us, but wholly from <hi>grace</hi> without us; and they will readily finde that by eying the ground and original of the promiſe, they will ſooner be encouraged and drawn to believe and to lay hold upon it, then by looking onely to the promiſe it ſelfe. Of all the wayes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to beare up a ſinking ſpirit, there is no conſideration like this, that from the beginning to the end of our ſalvation no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is primarily active but free grace. This is a firme bottome of comfort againſt the guilt of the moſt bloody and crimſon ſins,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115728:38"/> becauſe <hi>free grace</hi> is not tied to any rules, it may do what it pleaſeth. Some body that goes to heaven muſt be the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and what if thou beeſt he, whom God will make the everlaſting monument of the riches of his love and mercy in Chriſt? This is an impenetrable ſhield againſt the conſtant accuſations of Satan drawn from unworthineſſe, unprofitableneſſe, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to holy duties, and diſtractions in them. 'Tis true, may a beleever ſay, I am unworthy, and that which Satan makes the matter of his accuſation, is the daily matter of my confeſſions, and ſelf-judgings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; the ſinnes which he pleads againſt me with delight, I bemoane with tears of bitterneſſe: And were the way which leads to heaven, a <hi>ladder of duties,</hi> and not a <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chaine of free grace,</hi> I could not but fear, that the higher I climbe, the greater would my fall prove to be; every ſervice being like a brittle round that can beare no weight; &amp; the whole frame and ſeries of duties at the beſt, far ſhort of the ladder in <hi>Jacobs</hi> viſion, which had its foot ſtanding upon the earth, and its top reaching to heaven. But the whole way of ſalvation from firſt to laſt, is all of meere grace, <hi>that the promiſe might be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115728:39"/> ſure,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. Every link of the golden chaine is made up of free mercy, Election is free, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. Vocation free, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Justification free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 24. Sanctification free, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. Glorification free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And therefore though I can challenge nothing of right, yet I may ask every thing of mercy; eſpecially being invited by him, who ſeedes not his people with empty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but gives liberally unto every one that asketh, and upbraides not either with former ſinnes, or preſent failings, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, in the applying of every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe look with the eye of faith upon the greatneſſe of Gods power, which is able to fulfill to the leaſt iota whatever he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can aske or think, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. The confining of Gods power according to the narrow apprehenſions, and dwarfiſh thoughts that men naturally have of him in their hearts, the Scripture points out as the chief root of all that unbelief and diſtruſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115728:39"/> which is put forth in their lives: Thus the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe were ſeldome in any exigency which they looked upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of ſecond cauſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from; but they ſtraightways cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo into queſtion the power of God, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 78. 19, 20. <hi>They ſpake againſt God, they ſaid, Can God furniſh a table in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Behold, he ſmote the rock that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters guſhed out, and the ſtreames overflowed; but can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi> So when they were in the long captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they had many cleare and expreſſe promiſes of being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and brought back again into their own inheritance; yet meaſuring the truth of Gods Word, not by the ſtrength of his power, but by the improbabilities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities which did appeare to their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; they look upon themſelves not as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of hope, but as free among the dead, and as far from any expectation of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as dead and drie bones are from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving. <hi>Our bones</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are dried up, and our hopes are loſt, and we are cut off for our parts,</hi> Ezek. 37. 11. Thus the Sadduces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and deuided the great doctrine of the reſurrection, as being full of irreconcileable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115728:40"/> difficulties and inconſiſtencies. How a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a ſoul ſeparated ſhould be reunited; how a body not only ſeparated from the ſoul, but diſſolved into duſt ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compacted; how duſt ſcattered and blown up and down ſhould be recollected, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together beyond the line of their reaſon for to fathome or compaſſe. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therefore points out the ground of their errour to ariſe, not onely from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Scripture which had foretold it, but alſo of the power of God which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to effect it: <hi>Ye do erre, not knowing the Scrptures, nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29. Neceſſary therefore it is in the making uſe of any promiſe, that a beleever have ſuch conceptions of the power of God, as that whatever lets and impediments do ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the promiſe and the fulfilling of it, though as high as mountaines, and as ſtrong as the gates of hell, be yet by faith look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as difficulties which cannot check the power of God, but onely magnifie it: For elſe, if once we come to have jealous thoughts of the divine arme in which we truſt, or to fear that it might be incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by ſome inſuperable oppoſition; the hopes and expectations that we have of any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115728:40"/> good from the promiſe, muſt needs be weak and uncertaine. When God had promiſed to make <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of a ſeed, as numerous as the Stars of heaven, or the duſt of the earth, though reaſon could not but ſuggeſt unto him how unlikely he was to be a father and <hi>Sarah</hi> to be a mother, when age had dried up his body, and deaded the womb of <hi>Sarah,</hi> yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Againſt hope he beleeved in hope, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the father of many Nations,</hi> Rom. 4. 18. That is, when nature afforded no ground of hope or encouragement to confirme his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in the fulfilling of the promiſe, but ſuggeſted many poſing arguments to impleade and gainſay the truth of it, and to make his faith as feeble as his body; yet then he exerciſed the fulneſſe of aſſurance in believing and of hope in expecting the accompliſhment of all that God had ſpoken. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God, being fully perſwaded that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to performe,</hi> verſe 21, 22. So when afterwards God called him to that <hi>ſignal</hi> triall of his faith and obedience in the offering up of his only ſonne, and appointed himſelf to be the Prieſt as well
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115728:41"/> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be the ſacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though the ſtroake which <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand was ſtretched forth to give, would not onely have ended the life of his ſonne; but have cut off alſo the promiſe at the very root becauſe in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſeed was to be called: yet by the ſame eye of faith, by which before he looked through a dead womb, he now looks through a bleeding ſword unto the power of God, accounting that he was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19. That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he believed that rather then the promiſe of God ſhould not be certaine, the reſurrection of <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be more miraculous then his birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that God would magnifie his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in raiſing him out of the aſhes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſacrifice to be the heire of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then let one tittle of his Word fall to the ground unfulfilled. And thus ſhould every beleever as a true childe of <hi>Abraham</hi> endeavour to do, in looking from themſelves unto the power of God, for the making good of any promiſe which they in prayer do earneſtly ſeek, in faith do really beleeve, in hope do patiently wait for and expect. And though difficulties and temptations ſhould ariſe, which their reaſon cannot anſwer, their ſtrength can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115728:41"/> repell; yet not to caſt away their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but to caſt themſelves upon him who is both the ſtrength and wiſdom of his people, with whom things that are utterly impoſſible with men, are not only poſſible, but eaſie for him to bring to paſſe and to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Oh the happy peace and ſerenity that a beleever enjoyes, in every eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which befalls him, that can thus reſt and ſtay himſelfe, upon the promiſe and power of God! No <hi>valley</hi> of trouble will be to him without a <hi>doore</hi> of hope, no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> without <hi>Manna,</hi> no drie <hi>rock</hi> without <hi>water,</hi> no <hi>dungeon</hi> without <hi>light,</hi> no fiery <hi>trial</hi> without <hi>comfort,</hi> becauſe be hath the ſame Word and the ſame God to truſt unto, whoſe power open'd the ſea as a doore to be a paſſage from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> who fed Iſrael in the deſart with bread from heaven, and water from the rock, who filled <hi>Peters</hi> priſon with a ſhining light, who made the three children to walk to and fro a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the fiery furnace with joy and ſafety.</p>

The promiſes of men, though they be the expreſſions of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and reſolved good unto that perſon to whom they are made, yet they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a deficiency from a double principle: ſometimes through a want of power to give a being and exiſtency unto what they have ſpoken; they prove rather the fruitleſſe wiſhes of a friend that meanes well, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of one that hath ability to turne his words into deeds: But that which moſt frequently makes the promiſes of men to be as abortive conceptions, and not as full births, is the mutability and inconſtancy of their wills, whereby they are not only apt to recall and ſuſpend the fulfilling of what they promiſed, but alſo to change their love into hatred, and their promiſes into
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115728:42"/> menaces. The tree that in the ſummer is much eſteemed and ſet by for the grateful ſhade which it affordeth, in the cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is oft cut down for fuel: and ſo the ſame perſon, which in the heat of affection is made the object of many favours, in the keene blaſts of jealouſie becomes the ſubject of revenge and ruine. But it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the promiſes of God, whoſe power no lets or impediments can ariſe to hinder, whoſe will no contingencies or emergencies can fall out to alter. All his promiſes are in Chriſt not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> but in him, <hi>Yea,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in him <hi>Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>He is not a man that he ſhould repent,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 29.

                  <p>Fourthly, in making uſe of the promiſes, direct the eye of your faith to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, by which the various bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are held forth in them, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed and given to beleevers in the fitteſt and beſt ſeaſon; and thereby become both the more <hi>remarkeable,</hi> and the more <hi>uſefull.</hi> The works of Gods providence have a beauty and luſtre ſet upon them, from the appointed time and ſeaſon which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted unto them; the light of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115728:44"/> more deſireable by the interpoſition of the night, the reſt and darkneſſe of the night is rendered more grateful by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and toiles of the day. The former and the latter raine he gives in ſeaſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 24. the one to bring forth and cheriſh the new ſown ſeed, the other to ripen and make fruitful the harveſt. The ſummer and winter by an inviolable ordinance he hath made to ſucceed each other, the one to be as a key to open the womb of the earth, that it might diſcharge it ſelf of its many births; the other as a key to ſhut it, that ſo it might not languiſh and grow barren by an unintermitted travel. Now if the wiſdome of God hath to theſe common mercies wherein his enemies have a ſhare (as well as others,) ſet ſuch appointed times, as may make them more uſeful and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to his creatures: certainly he will not faile to performe to his people the promiſes of his free grace in that <hi>ſeaſon and fulneſſe of time,</hi> which may beſt ſuite with their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and his glory. Promiſes are not made and fulfilled at the ſame time, no more then ſowing and reaping are on the ſame day. God hath in his Word recorded them, as ſo many diſcoveries of his immutable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115728:45"/> and purpoſe, that thereby faith might have a ſure ground to relie upon him in all exigencies, and to expect a reliefe from him; but the ſeaſon and time of performance, God hath reſerved to himſelf, as beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only what to give, but when to give: ſo that beleevers though they may plead to God his promiſe, muſt yet be careful not to confine and limit him to times which they judge fitteſt; but wholy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne themſelves to his wiſe diſpoſe, to whom every creature looks, and receive their meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 15. If he feeds the ravens when they crie, much more will he ſatisfie his children when they pray; if to the one he opens his hand and gives liberally, to the other he will open his bowels, and give above what they can ask or think.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration of the wiſdome of God in the timing of his promiſes to the fitteſt ſeaſon, is exceeding uſefull to correct the haſty and impetuous deſires of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who if their mouths be not filled as ſoon as they be opened, if Gods promiſes be not fulfilled, as ſoon as they be pleaded, if they have not when they ask, do ſtraightways like <hi>Rachel</hi> crie out they die, or like <hi>Jonah, That it is better for them to die then to live,</hi> Jonah 4. 3.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115728:45"/> becauſe they do not obtaine, not what Gods will, but what their own will ſuggeſts to be beſt. Watches that go faſteſt do not alwayes go trueſt; no more are deſires that are moſt haſty, moſt regular. It is good in prayer to have the deſires wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with affection, and to be like an arrow drawn with full ſtrength, but yet there muſt be a ſubmiſſion exerciſed unto the holy and wiſe will of God, that ſo it may appear that we ſeek to him in a way of begging, and not by a way of conteſt; that we make him not the object only of our duties and our ſelves the end, but him to be both the object and the end of every ſervice which we give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 1. Rule 2.</hi> Promiſes in their performance conditional.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond direction is, that though the promiſes be <hi>abſolutely free in the making of them,</hi> having no other cauſe then Gods will, no other motive then his love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet <hi>in their performance they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,</hi> and have a dependency upon duties in us: they are fulfilled not only in us, but by us. To a clear explication of this rule, I ſhall propound an <hi>ordinary,</hi> but yet a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> diſtinction concerning the promiſes, which is this: There are promiſes <hi>of grace,</hi> and there are promiſes which are made <hi>to grace.</hi> The one are ſo <hi>abſolute,</hi> as that they do not depend upon any grace in us fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115728:46"/> or ſuppoſe any good qualifications in us to be partakers of them; ſuch are the promiſes of converſion and regeneration, in which grace makes way for it ſelfe, and works all the initial preparations, without any concurrence or activity on our part, we being as fully paſſive in our ſecond birth as we are in our firſt birth, in our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in our generation. The other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to grace are <hi>conditonal,</hi> not as ſuppoſing any thing to be performed by our ſtrength and power, or as if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were cauſes meriting the grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; but they are conditional in regard of a precedent qualification and fitneſſe in the ſubject that is to partake of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot be fulfilled, grace being made the condition of grace. Thus <hi>pardon of ſinne is promiſed to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, juſtification to them that beleeves, glory to him that is ſanctified, a crown to him that perſevereth, and increaſe in grace to him that improveth grace received.</hi> But the <hi>abſolute</hi> promiſe of converſion, and giving of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, though it have a kind of <hi>oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto conditional promiſes,</hi> in not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that aptitude and qualification of the ſubject by grace for the fulfilling of it, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115728:47"/> the other do for the performance of them; yet is it not <hi>abſolute</hi> in oppoſition to the uſe of external meanes, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as a neceſſary way to obtaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace. For as the decrees of God, though <hi>peremptory and unchangeable,</hi> do not exclude the endeavours of the creature, and the working of ſecond cauſes; no more doth the <hi>abſoluteneſſe of Gods promiſe in converſion ſhut out,</hi> but rather include the uſe and exerciſe of all meanes that lead to the end. True it is, that to hear ſavingly, to mingle faith with the Word, men cannot by any natural power or ability in the leaſt meaſure do; but yet God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould attend upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and afford their preſence to heare the Word, when preached and delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: And though theſe be ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have no immediate influence to the begetting or working of grace, yet are they ſo far neceſſary, as that no man can promiſe unto himſelf that ever he ſhall be converted, who doth either neglect or refuſe the uſing of thoſe meanes, in which God is pleaſed to diſpenſe his free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved grace.</p>
                  <p>This Direction is very uſefull in a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115728:47"/> double reſpect, to which it fitly ſerves,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to <hi>ſilence</hi> the prophane cavils of thoſe who make no other uſe of their <hi>naural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to good,</hi> and of the <hi>power of God</hi> in converſion, then to exempt themſelves from all attendance upon Ordinances, God being able by a powerful voice to bid them ariſe from the dead, when like <hi>Lazarus</hi> they lie in the grave of their ſins; as well as heale them, when like the <hi>Creeple</hi> they lie at the poole of the Sanctuary, expecting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Spirit upon the waters, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment being able to croſſe or fruſtrate the purpoſe of the Almighty. But as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works of God, ſo in converſion not his <hi>power</hi> onely, but his <hi>will</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable to his power, and doth modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it in the working, is to be obſerved and heeded. Some things he effecteth <hi>without meanes,</hi> not becauſe his power is infinite and ſtands not in need of any other aſſiſtance; but becauſe his <hi>will</hi> is it ſhould ſo work: other things though as immediately wrought by himſelfe, are accompliſhed in <hi>the uſe of meanes;</hi> not that either his <hi>will</hi> or <hi>power</hi> are <hi>unable</hi> to give an exiſtence unto them without any ſecondary helps, but that his <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is to have them ſo wrought and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115728:48"/> Such is the work of making a <hi>new heart,</hi> of infuſing <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> where it is wanting, which though it be <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> from God himſelf, is yet ordered by him to be effected in the uſe of meanes. As Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans put their phyſick in certaine ſyrups and liquors, which are <hi>vehicula medicinae,</hi> not at all of themſelves operative, but ſerviceable to the medicine that works the cure: ſo doth God by his Ordinances which are <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales gratiae,</hi> channels and conduit-pipes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for grace to run in, convey and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the precious bleſſing of a new and ſpiritual life to thoſe upon whom he is pleaſed to beſtow it. And therefore as the <hi>plea</hi> of thoſe is both <hi>weak and impious,</hi> who contemptuouſly turne their backs upon the preaching of the Word, and other external helps, as needleſſe and unneceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, it being Gods ſole work: ſo their <hi>expectation</hi> in the cloſe will be both <hi>ſad and fruitleſſe,</hi> ending rather in a juſt turning into hell by God, then in a ſaving and effectual turning thorow grace unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it ſerves to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> beleevers to an unwearied diligence in holy duties; as being the ready and expedite way to obtaine their deſires in the fulfilling of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115728:48"/> any promiſe which they ſtand in need of. The penny was given to the <hi>labourer</hi> in the vineyard, not to the <hi>loiterer</hi> in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. And the reward in the promiſe is not to him that ſits ſtill, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſalvation to drop into his lap, but to him that ſeeks and purſues after it; making Gods promiſe not a ground for his idleneſs, but a ſpur and motive to his diligence. The promiſes are <hi>wells of ſalvation</hi> flowing with the waters of life, but yet the ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that expects to be refreſhed by them, muſt be at paines to draw water out of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. 3. They are full <hi>breaſts of conſolation;</hi> but yet the weak Chriſtian, who is as the new-borne babe, or new-yeaned lamb, muſt ſuck theſe breaſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 11. if he will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their aliment. <hi>Etſi infirmus, etſi parvulus,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Austin) exige à Deo miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam. Non vides perbreves agnos, capiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus pulſantes ubera matrum, ut lacte ſatientur?</hi> Though thou be weak and little, yet ſeek and exact with importunity mercy from God. Do you not ſee how the young lambs do with their heads force down the milk from their damme, that they may be filled therewith? To wraſtle and ſtrive with God like <hi>Jacob</hi> for the gaining of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115728:49"/> is not ſuperfluous, becauſe God hath promiſed it, but neceſſary, becauſe he hath commanded it, <hi>Ezek. 36. 37. I will yet for this be inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> So, <hi>Jer. 29. 11, 12, I know the thoughts that I think towards you, thoughts of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not of evil, yet ſhall ye call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.</hi> Calling on God is not for his information, but for the exerciſe of beleevers obedience and ſubmiſſion. He will have faith as an hand to <hi>work,</hi> as well as an hand to <hi>receive.</hi> It was a ſcandal that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> brought upon the religion of the Iſraelites, that it made them idle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 8. And it is a wrong done to the promiſes of the Goſpel by carnal Libertines, who make uſe onely of them to countenance their ſloth, &amp; not to quicken their obedience. None that ever <hi>I</hi> have heard of have held marriage vain, or unneceſſary for the propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, who have yet been of opinion that the ſoul is not generated, but immediately created and infuſed by God: no more can any man rationally conclude, that, becauſe the promiſes of God are the declarations of his unchangeable purpoſe and will, therefore duties and endeavours are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115728:49"/> to the effecting of any good which he hath promiſed to conferre upon us.</p>

                  <p>The third Rule or Direction is, that there is a ſacred <hi>concatenation</hi> and <hi>dependency</hi> of one promiſe to another, which may not be <hi>violated,</hi> and a <hi>fixed order</hi> which may not be <hi>inverted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>mutual tye</hi> that is between the promiſes, in the application of them <hi>muſt not be broken:</hi> As the duties of the law are <hi>copulative,</hi> and may not in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is yielded unto it, be disjoyned, <hi>James</hi> 2. 20. So are the bleſſings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which may not be made uſe of, as <hi>ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from each other, like looſe and unſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pearles; but as <hi>collected</hi> and made into one intire chaine. God hath linked the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of pardon and repentance together, and no man may preſume that God will ever hearken unto him who <hi>begges</hi> the one, and <hi>neglects</hi> to ſeek the other. When he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115728:50"/> pacifies the conſcience, he melts the heart, and works repentance, as well as ſeales forgiveneſſe: So likewiſe hath God inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably knit <hi>grace and glory</hi> together, as that none can lay a juſt claime to the one, who is not firſt made partaker of the other; no man can expect to be an <hi>heire</hi> of heaven, that is not firſt a <hi>Saint</hi> on earth. Holineſs leads to happineſſe, as the rivulet to the ſea, as the way to the end: the one is as the foot of the ladder, and the other as the top. <hi>Summitas ſcalae attingitur, non volando, ſed aſcendendo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard: Glory which is the higheſt round, is not attained by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by an orderly aſcending unto it;</hi> the intermediate ſteps muſt not be skipt, but trodden. Oh! how <hi>vaine</hi> then are thoſe mens <hi>hopes,</hi> and how <hi>ſinful</hi> are their <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi> who ſtand upon the battlements of hell, and ſport themſelves with all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual delights of the fleſh, trampling under their impure feet with ſcorne the precious promiſes of holineſs, by which they ſhould be moulded unto all obedience! and yet at the ſame time ſtretch forth an hand of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to lay hold on the promiſes of life and eternal glory, as if they were the true heirs and proprietaries thereof. But
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115728:50"/> their forlorne condition which they would not ſee by the light of the Word, they ſhall reade by the flames of hell, being infinitely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more preſſed down under the weight of Gods diſpleaſure, and endleſſe deſpaire, then ever they were lifted up with the tranſient hopes of happineſſe, by a carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded preſumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the applying of the promiſes the <hi>order and method</hi> of them is not to be <hi>inverted,</hi> but to be <hi>obſerved.</hi> The promiſes which God hath made, are a full ſtore-houſe of all kinde of bleſſings; they include in them both the upper and the nether ſprings, the mercies of this life and of that which is to come: there is no good that can preſent it ſelf as an object to our deſires or thoughts, of which the promiſes are not a ground for faith to believe and hope to expect the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of. But yet our uſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them muſt be regular, and ſuch as ſuites both the pattern and precept which Chriſt hath given us. The <hi>patterne</hi> we have in that moſt abſolute prayer of his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9, 10. wherein he ſhews what is chiefly to be deſired by us; the Sanctification of his Name in our hearts, the coming of his kingdome into our ſoules, the doing of his will in our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115728:51"/> lives, are to be ſought for before, and above our daily bread. We may not be more anxious for <hi>food,</hi> then for <hi>grace.</hi> The <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> we have in his moſt heavenly Sermon, <hi>Mat. 6. 33. Seek ye firſt the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Promiſes are to be improved in prayer and other duties, <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> for holineſſe, and <hi>ſecondarily</hi> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward comforts. The <hi>ſoul</hi> is more worth then <hi>body,</hi> as the <hi>body</hi> is more worth then the <hi>raiment,</hi> and therefore the principal care of every one ought to be to ſecure the well-fare of his ſoul, by intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the promiſes of life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſſe: but yet even here alſo a Method muſt be obſerved, and the Law of the Scripture muſt be exactly followed, which tells us that God firſt gives <hi>grace;</hi> and then <hi>glory, Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. As it is a ſin to <hi>divide</hi> grace from glory, and to ſeek the one without the other; ſo is it alſo a ſinne to be <hi>prepoſterous in our ſeeking,</hi> to look <hi>firſt</hi> after happineſſe, and <hi>then after</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: no man can rightly be ſolicitous about the crown, but he muſt firſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about the race; nor can any be truly thoughtful about his intereſt in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115728:51"/> of glory, that doth not firſt make good his title to the promiſes of grace. Salvation, endleſſe life, fellowſhip with Angels, and the firſt-borne of heaven; they (are as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls them) <hi>promiſſum finale,</hi> the laſt things in order that God hath to give, or that we have to ask; and therefore we may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the order of them, but wait upon God in his own way. What the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22, 23. That in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive, but every man in his own order;</hi> may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken concerning the promiſes of the Goſpel, that in Chriſt all ſhall be fulfilled, but every promiſe in its own order.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Direction is to meditate <hi>throughly</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> upon the promiſes, and to deale with them as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did with the things that were ſpoken concerning Chriſt, <hi>ſhe kept and pondered them in her heart, Luk.</hi> 2. 19. The limbeck doth not put any vertue into the herbs, but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115728:52"/> it <hi>diſtills and extracts</hi> whatever is efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uſeful from them. The <hi>Bee</hi> doth not derive any ſweetneſſe to the flower, but by its induſtry it <hi>ſucks</hi> the latent honey from it: ſo meditation <hi>conveyeth</hi> nothing of worth unto the promiſe, but it <hi>draws forth</hi> the ſweetneſſe, and diſcovers the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, which elſe without it would be little taſted or diſcerned. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought that a beleevers looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a promiſe, is not unlike a mans behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heavens in a ſtill and ſerene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, who when he firſt caſts up his eye, ſees haply a ſtarre or two only to peep, and with difficulty to put forth a feeble and diſappearing light, by and by he looks up again, and then both their number and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre are increaſed, a while after he views the heavens again, and then the whole fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, from every quarter, with a number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe multitude of ſtars, is richly enamelled, as with ſo many golden ſtuds: So when a Chriſtian firſt turnes his thoughts towards the promiſes, the appearances of light and comfort which ſhine from them, do oft-times ſeeme to be as weak and imperfect raies which neither ſcatter feares nor darkneſſe; when again he ſets himſelf to ripen and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115728:52"/> his thoughts upon them, then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and comfort which they yield to the ſoul, is both more cleare and diſtinct: but when the heart and affections are fully fixed in the meditation of a promiſe, Oh! what a bright mirrour is the promiſe then to the eye of faith? What legions of beauties do then appear from every part of it, which both ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and fill the ſoul of a beleever with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? How doth he ſometimes admire <hi>free grace,</hi> whereby God becomes a <hi>debtour,</hi> not by <hi>taking</hi> any thing from us, but by <hi>promiſing</hi> great things unto us? How doth he triumph in the fulneſſe of mercy which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflows in it, as being enough to fill the wideſt capacity, and to ſupply the greateſt neceſſity? How doth he ſtay himſelf upon the <hi>ſtability</hi> of the promiſe, it being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſtrength it ſelf, <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael, who cannot lie?</hi> One promiſe throughly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and meditated upon, is like to a morſel of meat well chew'd and digeſted, which diſtributeth more nouriſhment and ſtrength to the body, then great quantities taken down whole. <hi>Samſon</hi> when he had made a great ſlaughter of his enemies, and laid them heapes upon heapes, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines that though God had given him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115728:53"/> ſo mighty a deliverance, he was ready to die for thirſt, <hi>Judges</hi> 15. 18. So many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who make it their work to heap promiſe upon promiſe, may yet be ſorely diſtreſſed for want of comfort, if by meditation they do not dive into the depths of the promiſe. The water wherewith <hi>Samſon</hi> was refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came forth out of an hollow place which the Lord clave in the jaw; and the ſprings of comfort which beleevers drink of, come out of the clifts of the promiſe, which faith and meditation makes in it. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſwade ſuch as are deſirous and willing to make the utmoſt of every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to put in practice this much neglected duty, without which every Ordinance is of little fruit. The Word as it muſt have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration before it, which like the <hi>plough</hi> fits the ground for the reception of the ſeed; ſo muſt it have meditation to follow after, which is as the <hi>harrow</hi> to cover and hide the new-ſown ſeed, or elſe the fowles of the aire will pick it up. The <hi>Sacrament</hi> as it is food to be received with an <hi>appetite;</hi> ſo is it to be <hi>digeſted</hi> with meditation, elſe the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment will be little. The promiſes as they muſt be read in the Scripture with diligence; ſo muſt they be called to remembrance by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115728:53"/> many ſerious muſings and actings of our thoughts upon them; elſe they will never prove ſtrengthening and reviving cordials. Roſes are ſweeter in the <hi>ſtill</hi> then on the <hi>ſtalke;</hi> and promiſes are more fragrant in the <hi>heart</hi> then in the <hi>book.</hi> The grapes hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the vine, do not make the wine that cheares the heart of man; but the grapes that are ſqueiſed and trodden in the wine-preſſe; no more do the promiſes as they ſtand in the Bible work joy and gladneſſe; but as they are pondered in the minde, and like preſſed grapes have their juice and vertue drawn from them, which by a percolation in the thoughts turnes into a moſt ſoveraigne and precious liquor.</p>

                  <p>The fifth direction is, to be <hi>much in the uſe and application of promiſes,</hi> though we do not finde ſuch viſible effects either of grace or comfort iſſuing from them, as we expect or deſire. <hi>Elijah</hi> when he went up to the top of mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and fell upon his face before the Lord to pray for raine,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115728:54"/> he ſent his ſervant ſeven times to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſea, before he ſaw ſo much as the appearance of a cloud of an hand-breadth, yet was he not diſcouraged, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 43. So beleevers though they have been much in muſing upon the promiſes in their thoughts, frequent in pleading and ſpreading them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in prayer, and after all their lookings towards heaven, ſay as the ſervant of <hi>Elijah</hi> when he looked towards the ſea, <hi>non eſt quicquam,</hi> there is nothing; yet muſt they not caſt away their confidence in them; or neglect the daily uſe of them; becauſe the promiſe, and <hi>the word that goeth forth out of Gods mouth, ſhall not returne unto him void, but ſhall accompliſh that which he pleaſeth, and it ſhall proſper in the thing whereunto he ſent it,</hi> Iſa. 55. 11. The manner of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it may be various, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it is moſt certain. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the promiſe deſcends ſometimes like raine in viſible ſhowres, producing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects of joy, and peace in the ſoule; ſometimes it falls like dew in a ſilent and imperceptible way; without making any diſcernable alteration in the heart of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever: the vertue which it puts forth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but yet withall hidden and ſecret. As
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115728:54"/> gold put and boyled in broth, helps to make it ſtrengthening and cordial, which if weighed afterwards in the ſcale, is found to loſe little or nothing of its former weight, or to ſuffer any dimiunition of its ſubſtance: ſo the promiſe when much meditated on, when frequently applied by a beleever to his preſent ſtraits, yields a ſecret influence and ſupport, though to his apprehenſion no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or quickening doth appear to have iſſued from it. Then it is as the cork to the net to keep it floating in a ſea of difficulties, when every moment we look for nothing elſe but a diſmal and irrecoverable periſhing amidſt thoſe many rolling waves and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that paſſe over us.</p>
                  <p>This direction I propound the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſtians lying under fears, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and temptations; are not ſeldom like ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty patients under diſeaſes and infirmities, who if they finde not a preſent benefit in the uſe of Phyſick, either in the removal, or in the abatement of their diſtempers, do ſtraightways conclude, that it were better for them to beare the paine of the diſeaſe, then to trouble themſelves with the daily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of fruitleſs remedies &amp; preſcripts; not conſidering that Phyſick may be uſeful to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115728:55"/> prevent the danger of the diſeaſe, when it doth not work the cure; to keep them from growing worſe, though it do not make them better: So beleevers when by the uſe of promiſes and other Ordinances they finde no ſenſible alteration for the better in reſpect of their preſent condition, are apt to throw off the uſe of meanes, as things that ſtand them in little or no ſtead. Though they uſe the precepts of the Word, as a lamp to guide their feet, yet they ſtumble; though they uſe the promiſes as a ſtaffe to ſupport them, yet they fall; though they beg and pray for ſtrength, yet they are feeble; to what end therefore ſhould they be much in the uſe of ſuch helps, as they cannot finde either to relieve them, or better them? Such expoſtulations and complaints I ſhall onely anſwer, with a ſuitable <hi>ſtory</hi> related in the lives of the ancient Fathers, which is this: One of the fraternity came to the old Father; and complained, <hi>Father, I do often deſire of the ancient Fathers ſome inſtructions for the good of my ſoule, and whatſoever they tell me, I forget all.</hi> The old man had two em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty veſſels, and bid him bring the one, and poure water into it, and waſh it cleane, and then poure out the water, and ſet it up clean
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115728:55"/> in its place. Which when the young man had accordingly done, he demanded, <hi>Which now of the two veſsels is the more cleane?</hi> The young man anſwered, <hi>That into which I pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed water, and waſhed it.</hi> Then replied the old Father, So is the ſoul which oftentimes heareth Gods Word, though it remember not what it hath heard, yet it is more clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from ſin then that ſoul that never comes to heare. And ſo may I ſay to them that complaine, they ruminate often upon the promiſes in their thoughts, pleade them in their prayers, read them in the Word, but yet finde no benefit or fruit from them; that in ſo doing, they are not onely more holy and free from luſts then others who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them; but far better then otherwiſe themſelves would be, ſhould they not be imployed in ſuch ſpiritual and bleſſed ſervices.</p>

                  <p>THe ſixth Rule or direction is, to abide and <hi>continue in a holy waiting upon God,</hi> untill he who is the maker of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, become the fulfiller of them. <hi>Our eyes wait upon the Lord our God,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>untill that he have mercy upon us,</hi> Pſ. 123. 2. Some promiſes are like unto the <hi>Almond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> which putteth out upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the ſpring, and bringeth forth an early fruit: they are not long pleaded, ere they be fulfilled; and have their bleſſings like ripe fruit to drop into the mouth of the eater. Others are like to the <hi>Mulberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> which is ſlow and backward in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of its ſap unto the branches: they are long before they bud forth into any
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115728:56"/> appearances which may diſcover any ſtep and progreſſe to be made in order to their future accompliſhment: ſo that they who are the inheriters of them, though they need not to fear their failing the appointed time, yet they need patience to expect and waite their fulfilling. The great promiſe which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> of multiplying his ſeed like the ſtars of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. did for two hundred and fifteen years continue its motion like to a ſlow-paced planet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in all that tract of time gone little of that courſe which it was to finiſh: for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was ſeventy five years old when the promiſe was made, and an hundred years old when <hi>Iſaac</hi> who was the firſt bloſſome of that promiſe was born: <hi>Iſaac</hi> was threeſcore yeares old before <hi>Jacob</hi> was borne, <hi>Jacob</hi> was an hundred and thirty yeares old when he went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then there were no more then ſeventy ſouls that had iſſued from the loynes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But yet in the latter two hundred and fifteen years, <hi>When the time of the promiſe drew nigh which God had ſworne to</hi> Abraham, <hi>the people grew and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in</hi> Egypt, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 17. They that were but ſeventy at their going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> were at their coming forth ſix hundred thouſand
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115728:57"/> three thouſand five hundred and fifty, the males onely being numbred from twenty years old and upward, beſides the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> which was forbidden to be counted, <hi>Num.</hi> 1. 46, 47. Seeing therefore that there is oft-times a long intervall between the ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and the harveſt of the promiſe, between its making and its fulfilling, it is neceſſary for beleevers to waite upon God, who is <hi>optimus opportunitatis arbiter,</hi> one that can beſt date and time his own promiſes; and to expect with patience the appointed time of the promiſe, which at the end ſhall ſpeak and not lie: <hi>Though it tarry, waite for it,</hi> Hab. 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>Now if you aske, what waiting is: It is not any particular grace, as varniſh is not a particular colour; but it is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion well-nigh of all graces, and therefore in Scripture we ſhall finde it to be joyned to the chief of graces, ſo as by its conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, to adde a perfection and luſtre to them. It is joyned with faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16. <hi>He that beleeveth, ſhall not make haſte.</hi> With hope, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> With patience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>The husbandman waiteth for the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115728:57"/> precious fruit of the earth, and hath long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for it.</hi> With ſubmiſſion and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſal.</hi> 37. 7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord,</hi> [or be ſilent to the Lord] <hi>and wait patiently for him.</hi> With perſeverance, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Keep mercy and judgement, and wait on thy God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> All theſe graces thus coupled with waiting, is a beleever to exerciſe in his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God the performance of any promiſe, and to take heed that he let not his faith to end in diffidence, his hope to languiſh into deſpaire, his ſubmiſſion and patience to turne into murmurings, his perſeverance to expire in backſliding, and to ſay as that wicked King, <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait upon him any longer?</hi> 2 King. 6. 33. A good heart, though it will not let God wait long, no not at all for its obedience, yet it will wait as long as God ſees good for his promiſe, ſaying only with <hi>David, Remember the word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope,</hi> Pſal. 119. 49.</p>

                  <p>The ſeventh direction is, To ſingle and cull out of the many promiſes which God hath made for pardon, holineſſe, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proviſion, ſome one or two of every kind, which we may reſort unto with ſpeed in any extremity. Weak and infirme perſons, beſides the many Phyſical herbs, diſtilled waters, magiſterial powders, coſtly electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with which their cloſets are plentifully furniſhed, have uſually ſome peculiar cordial which in the day they carry about them, and at night ſet at their beds head to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and repell fainting ſits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers beſides thoſe promiſes of all ſorts with which they are to ſtore themſelves, have in a conſtant readineſſe ſome few ſpecial promiſes, which upon every occaſion that may befall them, they may quickly have recourſe unto, both for ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And here though I ſhall not preſcribe and limit any in their choiſe, but leave them to the free uſe of ſuch Scriptures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as themſelves by experience have found to be full of life and ſweetneſſe, yet it will not be amiſſe to recommend the uſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115728:58"/> of ſome few eminent promiſes of divers kinds out of the full ſtore-houſe of the Word, which may ſerve as ſo many meet cordials to revive the ſpirit of drooping Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ſeveral kindes of neceſſities that may afflict them. Are any burthened with the guilt of ſinne, ſo as that their ſoule draweth nigh unto the pit of deſpaire? What more joyful tidings can ever their eares heare, then a proclamation of free mercy made by the Lord himſelfe unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and repenting ſinners? What more glorious and bleſſed ſight can their eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Name of God written in ſundry of his choice attributes, as in ſo many golden letters for them to read? <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſſe and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſinne,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. He is <hi>the Lord,</hi> who only hath <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> the abſolute power of life and death in his hands; but he is the <hi>Lord God merciful,</hi> who far more willingly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth his pardons in forgiving, then exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth his juſtice in condemning; like the Bee that gathers honey with delight, but ſtings not once unleſs ſhe be much provoked.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115728:59"/> He is <hi>gracious,</hi> not incited to mercy by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts in the object, but moved by goodneſſe in himſelf; his love ſprings not from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in our beauty, but from pitty to our deformity. He is <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> bearing with patience renued and often repeated injuries, which he might by power revenge upon him who is the doer. He is <hi>abundant in goodneſſe;</hi> grace overfloweth more in him then ſinne can do in any. Sin in the creature is but a vicious quality, but goodneſſe in him is his nature. He is <hi>abundant in truth;</hi> as he is good in making the promiſes, ſo is he true in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them; when men deale unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, he breaks not his Covenant with them; He <hi>keeps mercy for thouſands;</hi> former ages have not exhauſted the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his mercy, ſo as that ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations can finde none: there are ſtill freſh reſerves of mercy, and that not for a <hi>few,</hi> but for <hi>thouſands.</hi> He <hi>forgives iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne;</hi> not <hi>pence,</hi> but <hi>talents</hi> are forgiven by him; not ſinnes of the leaſt ſiſe are onely pardoned, but ſinnes of the greateſt dimenſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as this promiſe in which the Name of God is ſo richly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, doth fully anſwer the heſitancies, doubts and perplexities of ſuch who fear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115728:59"/> for number to be ſo many, for ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to be ſo great, as that ſometimes they queſtion, Can God pardon? ſometimes, Will he ever ſhew mercy to ſuch a wretched Prodigal?

As the promiſes are uſeful to ſtrengthen faith; ſo are examples to confirme and aſſure ſenſe, which is continually apt to implead what faith beleeves, and to queſtion what God hath ſpoken. God hath promiſed, that <hi>though our ſinnes be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be white as wooll,</hi> Iſa. 1. 18.

Thus <hi>David</hi> in his low condition ſtrengthens his faith and hope in God from this ground, <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, and were not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Pſal. 22. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>This direction is alwayes of uſe to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the ordinary and daily application which they make of the Promiſes, becauſe examples, as they are powerful in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading obedience to every precept which commands it; ſo are they alſo, efficacious to ſtrengthen &amp; confirm faith when exerciſed on any promiſe. But it is chiefly uſeful in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, when dangers which are inſuperable do at any time inviron us. Beſides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which faith uſeth as a ſupport, it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115728:62"/> good to have in our eye ſome ſuch example as <hi>Daniel,</hi> whom God preſerved in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons den, ſealing up their mouthes by his power that they ſhould not hurt him, before the King had ſealed the mouth of the den with his ſignet, that he might not come forth. When ſad deſertions and temptations do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us, it is uſefull to call to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſome ſuch inſtance as <hi>Heman,</hi> who complaines that <hi>he was laid in the loweſt pit, that he was afflicted with all Gods waves, that he was ready to die from his youth up, that he was diſtracted while he ſuffered his terrors, Pſal.</hi> 88.

                  <p>The ninth rule or directions is, <hi>To keep, and preſerve entire our communion with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</hi> The dependency which every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever hath on the Spirit is very great, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the ſoul, as the ſoul is unto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the originall and principle of all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life and motion. What are any untill he quicken them, and by his power faſhion them unto holineſſe, but as ſo many liveleſſe lumps of undigeſted clay? And what are the beſt without his continual breathings upon them, but as ſo many disjoynted and weak members, which have neither conſtancy nor uniformity in their motions or actions? Grace in its vigour and ſtrength abides in the heart, as light in the houſe, by way of emanation and effuſion, rather then by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency. An inſtrument when it hath an edge ſet upon it, doth not at all cut any thing, till it be guided and moved by the hand of an artificer; no more doth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian when he hath an habituall aptitude
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115728:64"/> through grace to work, yet do or performe any ſervice without the concurrence and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt, quickning, exciting and applying the habitual power unto particular duties. Neceſſary therefore it is, that beleevers be circumſpect in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their communion with him, and not to provoke him to ſtand at a diſtance from them, who is the fountain both of their grace and comfort. But the neceſſity of it will more particularly appear, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in how much need we daily ſtand, of the conſtant aſſiſtance and powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the holy Spirit, to make the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of all the promiſes to be effectual unto us both for ſupport and comfort. He alone it is, who is the mighty worker of that noble and divine grace of ſaving faith, by which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are enabled to lay hold of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and by them of Chriſt, in whom they all meet, as ſo many lines in their common centre. He it is, who opens the eyes of the underſtanding, and fills the heart with an heavenly light, by which the worth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe of thoſe things which are given of God in the promiſes, are judged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. He it is, who brings to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the faithful ſayings of the Goſpel,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115728:64"/> and makes them to be as words ſpoken in ſeaſon to him that is weary. He it is, who teacheth beleevers to plead the promiſes in their ſupplications unto God, and <hi>when they know not what to pray for as they ought, maketh requeſt for them with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that cannot be uttered.</hi> He it is, who by way of obſignation doth ſeal and ratifie the promiſes unto the faithful, and that in a peculiar and tranſcendent manner. In the aſſurance and ſecurity which is given for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, we only have the wax ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the impreſſion and ſculpture of the ſeale, the ſignet ſealing is not at all looked after, if the one be ſafe, it matters not though the other be loſt: But in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the promiſes, beleevers do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe both; they have the holy Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is as the ſeale ſealing, and the graces of the Spirit, which are as the ſeal ſealed and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their hearts. The Spirit by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial teſtimony doth aſſure them of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their ſalvation, and ſeale them up unto it, acording to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God, and heires with Chriſt.</hi> The graces of the Spirit which are his lively image and impreſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115728:65"/> their ſoules, do alſo evidence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame thing, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Hereby we know that we are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a direction of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance unto all, who would gladly reap profit and advantage from the promiſes, to keep firme and to ſtrengthen their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Spirit, who is the only <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour</hi> to inſtruct them how to manage the promiſes to the beſt improvement of them, the moſt powerful <hi>Advocate</hi> to furniſh them with arguments to plead at the throne of grace their right unto them and their intereſt in them, the moſt effectual <hi>Comforter</hi> to ſupport their hearts with confidence, to fill them with joy, while they waite upon God for the performance of his promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If he be <hi>grieved</hi> by our careleſſe demeanour towards him, it is not any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that can make us glad; if he be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi> to withdraw and ſuſpend his light, there are no irradiations from the promiſes that can free us from the darkneſſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; if he <hi>be made to turne our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> by voluntary defections from him, none of the promiſes can ſpeak peace unto us.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115728:65"/> How vaine and ungrounded then are the preſumptions of thoſe who build their hopes of heaven and ſalvation upon the promiſes of mercy, &amp; yet neglect all communion with the Spirit of holineſſe? Who reſt in the teſtimony of their own ſpirit, miſguided by falſe rules, and cheated by Satans ſubtilties, &amp; look not at all after the teſtimony and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit, without whom all the promiſes of the Goſpel, are but as deeds and inſtruments with <hi>Labels</hi> hanging at them without ſeales to confirme them, which do not operate, or convey any thing of right unto thoſe that are poſſeſſed of them.</p>

                  <p>The tenth direction in the right uſe of the promiſes, no leſſe weighty then any is, <hi>To be truly thankful for the leaſt dawnings of mercy for the ſmalest pledge and earneſt of comfort which the promiſes at any time do afford unto us.</hi> The Angel rebuked, and reproached thoſe who deſpiſed the day of ſmall things, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 10. who with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115728:66"/> eyes, with unbeleeving and miſgiving hearts did look upon the poor and meane beginnings of the rebuilding of the Temple, as ſuch which were altogether unlikely to terminate in a glorious ſtructure, and to have the top-ſtone thereof laid with ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and acclamations of joy. And no leſſe are thoſe Chriſtians to be reproved who <hi>eſteem any of the conſolations of God to be ſmall;</hi> who if they be not at firſt filled with the ſpiritual ſuavities of the promiſes, take little or no notice of the ſupport and ſuſtentation which they receive daily from them; who if they preſently enjoy not what they haſtily deſire, can neither thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept of any pledges of mercy which God hath freely vouchſafed them, nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently waite for the ſure performance of the promiſes which he hath made them. It is the uſual method of God to fulfill his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by certaine ſteps and degrees, to make his ſalvation to break forth like the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which begins in an imperfect twilight; but ceaſeth not till it grow up into a bright day. The firſt glimmerings of peace and comfort which ſpring from the promiſes, are accompanied with great mixtures of darkneſſe, but yet they are of a growing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115728:66"/> and prevailing nature; and therefore are not to be deſpiſed, but to be thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and rejoyced in, as the happy earneſts of an enſuing day, in which the ſoul is as full of ſpiritual ſerenity and joy, as the firmament is of light, when the Sunne is in its verticall point. In the beſtowing of his favours, God deales with beleevers as <hi>Boaz</hi> did with <hi>Ruth,</hi> he firſt gave her a liberty to gleane in his fields, then invited her to eat bread at his table, and to dip her morſel in the vineger, and laſtly gave himſelf: So God firſt in a ſparing manner, and at ſome diſtance makes a diſcovery of his love and good will unto them, then in a more familiar and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way he encourageth them by his promiſes to draw neere unto him, and to taſte how good the Lord is to thoſe that fear him: And then as the complement of all, he gives his Spirit into their boſomes to aſſure them of his love, and their intereſt in whatever might make them perfectly happy. <hi>After that ye beleeved, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. But the ready and ſpeedy way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all this, is to be truly thankful for the leaſt appearance of mercy that ſhines forth from the promiſes, and to count it worthy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115728:67"/> of all acceptation, to receive it with ſuch joy as the morning was wont to be anciently ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the people went out, and cried, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Welcome ſuch light.

Fidelis autem in modico, cenſetur dignus munere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ampliori,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard:</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful perſon receives no increaſe, but what he hath formerly received turnes to his ruine. But the grateful perſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thought worthy of more ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>This direction I gladly would that thoſe Chriſtians ſhould often have in their thoughts, who are ſo much in complaining what they want, as that they never bleſſe God for what they enjoy. When any come into their company, their eares are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115728:67"/> afflicted with their mournful notes, how few their comforts are, how little the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is which they reap by the promiſes, but their hearts are never quickened to bleſs God on their behalfe, by their thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the leaſt mercy that God hath vouchſafed them; when as indeed it is a temper moſt befitting a Chriſtian not to let the ſmalleſt of his favours to paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved or unacknowledged. The ſwine eats the fruit that falls from the tree, but never looks up from whence it comes; but the Dove picks not up a graine without caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up its eye to heaven; it eats and then looks up, then picks again, and then looks up againe: And ſo ſhould a beleever lift up an eye of thankfulneſſe unto God for every beame of light and hope which he beholds in his Word, though it ſhine only through a narrow cranny. I thank God in Chriſt, ſaith holy <hi>Baines,</hi> ſuſtentation I have, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſuavities I taſte none. When we do not lie rejoycing in the armes and boſome of God as a Father, it is a mercy worthy of our thankfulneſſe, that we may lodge ſafely in his houſe; when we do not behold the ſmiles of his face, it is a mercy that we may hear his voice in his Word; when we have not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115728:68"/> the ring put on as an ornament, it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that we have any piece of a broken ring left with us, as a pledge and token that in our extremity he will not forſake us.</p>
                  <p>To encreaſe the number of theſe poſitive rules, were a task not in it ſelf difficult, nor yet happily to many weak ones altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; but becauſe it is farre eaſier for a Phyſician to write <hi>Recipes,</hi> then for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to take the many repeated and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>potions:</hi> I ſhall forbeare to adde more, as fearing I have been already too burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and prolix in theſe; and ſhall onely recommend what hath been ſpoken to the ſerious practice of beleevers without the leaſt infringing of their liberty to uſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which either their own or others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may ſuggeſt as profitable.

He did not own them as thoſe to whom he would impart the ſaving myſteries of his Goſpel; or joyne himſelfe unto them in the ſame bond of love and friendſhip, as he did with thoſe who with an <hi>entire and ſincere heart</hi> beleeved on him. The five fooliſh Virgins went farre in their waiting for the bridegroome; they took lamps with them to meet him, and kept
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115728:69"/> their lights for a ſeaſon burning; but yet at his coming the doore was ſhut againſt them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 11. And ſhall the faith of Gods lect and ſanctified ones be of no better alloy, then the faith of hypocrites and other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impenitent ſinners? Yea, ſhall the confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> concerning Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Thou art the Sonne of the living God,</hi> be no whit better then that of the devils? <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 29. who with a loud voice cry out, <hi>Jeſus thou Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi> Shall it be diſtinguiſhed from it no more in its worth, then it is in its words? But as the paleſt Gold doth much exceed the moſt glittering Alchimy, which though it ſeeme to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie the gold in its luſtre; yet hath it not the leaſt affinity with it in its reall vertue and worth: ſo the ſmalleſt grain of ſaving faith by which a beleever cloſeth with Chriſt in the promiſes, is more precious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then a meere aſſent unto the truth of the Word, which reſteth in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but hath no quickening influence upon the will and deſires: the one being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare credence, and the other a divine affiance. This was it which put a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of Chriſt, and the <hi>Devils</hi> acknowledgement of him,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115728:70"/> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Hoc dicebat</hi> Petrus, <hi>ut Chriſtum fide amplecteretur; hoc dicebant Daemones, ut Chriſtus ab cis recederet:</hi> This ſpake <hi>Peter,</hi> that he might imbrace Chriſt; this ſaid the devils, that Chriſt might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them. And this fiducial appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the diſtinguiſhing character which the Scripture makes between the faith of true beleevers and others; it being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſcribed by a rolling and ſtaying of its ſelfe upon God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. ſometimes by a truſting in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 4. ſometimes by receiving of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 6. ſometimes by a coming unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 36. All which expreſſions do ſpeak the ſpiritual motions and affections of the heart towards Chriſt in cleaving and adhering unto him, which beleevers onely exerciſe and not hypocrites or caſtawayes. And therefore they are ſaid not to rely on God, or to look towards him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 1. Not to truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 22. not to receive Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 11. not to come unto him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. Their faith is a forme of faith, but it wants the power and efficacy which accompanies ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p>This Cautionary Rule is with the more circumſpection to be heeded, in regard that multitude of profeſſors do reſt themſelves
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115728:70"/> contented in that general acknowledgement and aſſent which they yield to the truths of the Goſpel, though haply the chief enduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which they are led unto it, be no other then cuſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> education, or the authority of the Church. They think that the believing there is a God, that Chriſt is the Saviour of the world, that he died for ſinners, is faith enough to carry them out of the wilderneſſe into <hi>Canaan,</hi> out of the world into heaven. But alas! this and much more may be beleeved, and yet no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit at all accrue unto them who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the certainty of theſe ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall verities. Here the Logicians rule holds true, <hi>Medicina curat Socratem, non hominem;</hi> Phyſick is not given to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to cure the <hi>Species,</hi> but to every man <hi>in individu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> to heal his perſon. Chriſt and his promiſes are not beneficial unto any, but unto them who make a particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both unto themſelves. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is it to an inſolvent debtour to believe that there are rich mines of gold in that land into which he is fled to ſhelter himſelf from his creditors? What relief is it to a thirſty man, that there is a full vintage of cordiall and refreſhing wines growing not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115728:71"/> farre from him, if he have no hope that he ſhall taſte the leaſt drop of it? What ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is it to a condemned perſon to be aſſured that there is a pardon granted and ſealed for many, if there be no ground for him to conceive that his name is included in it? No more can it advantage any man to believe that Chriſt died to reconcile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to God, and that by a glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the grave, he hath aſcended the throne of Majeſty, and lives for ever to make interceſſion for them; unleſſe with the beliefe of theſe bleſſed truths, there be conjoyned a particular reliance upon Chriſt for ſalvation, and a caſting of a mans ſelfe into the armes of his free mercy for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and the juſtifying of his perſon at the tribunal of God. Do not the devils beleeve a God and tremble? <hi>James</hi> 1. 19. Do they not acknowledge Chriſt his Sonne? <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 34. And bow the knee unto him? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. Do not they know and beleeve that Chriſt died in general for ſinners, and that they which fix their confidence in him ſhall be ſaved by him? What article of the Creed is it, which they yield not an aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? And ſhall the faith whereby beleevers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115728:71"/> are juſtified, not exceed the faith of theſe infernal ſpirits?</p>
                  <p>But if it be ſaid, That the aſſent which the devils yield is full of force and coaction, and is commanded by the evidence and Majeſty of thoſe infallible truths which they do not at all love or affect; but the general belief which Chriſtians have of the revealed truths of the Goſpel, is altogether free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and is thereby diſtinguiſhed from the faith of devils. This difference, though it may ſeeme at firſt bluſh ſomewhat ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet is it both inſufficient and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent for that end to which it is aſſigned; in regard that the diſtinction which it makes of the one aſſent from the other, is from what is meerly accidental, and not from what is eſſential to the nature and being of faith. For they who make faith to be an act of the underſtanding onely, and to conſiſt in an aſſent unto the truth of thoſe things which God hath revealed, cannot properly fetch the eſſential difference which is between the faith of devils and the faith of Chriſtians, from the voluntarineſſe or involuntarineſſe of the aſſent, from the liking or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the truths which they beleeve, becauſe thoſe are acts of another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115728:72"/> in which by them faith is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſeated. Beſides the aſſent which the good Angels give unto the glorious truths of the Goſpel, which with diligence they look into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. is both voluntary and delightful, and yet it is moſt diſtinct and differing from the credence and aſſent which beleevers do give unto the ſame truths, it not being accompanied with a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reliance for life and ſalvation, as it alwayes is in beleevers, who do with a juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith embrace and apply the promiſes of the Goſpel unto themſelves. A man may be called to be a witneſs to a Will to averre the truth of it, though he have no legacy given unto him in it: ſo the Angels as ſo many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly witneſſes do affirme and aſſent unto the truth of thoſe things which Chriſt hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Goſpel as in his laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: But beleevers are as ſo many <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,</hi> which have particular bleſſings therein bequeathed unto them, &amp; therefore muſt not reſt in a general belief of the truth of the things, but muſt claime their propriety and intereſt in them, before they can ever have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefit or comfort from them.</p>
                  <p>But if it be further objected, that the Scripture doth in many places attribute ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115728:72"/> to a general faith, and that the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions faith which our Saviour ſo much commended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 10. ſeemeth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no more then an hiſtorical belief of Chriſts power and divinity: that <hi>Peters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. was but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: that <hi>Martha</hi>'s faith, <hi>John.</hi> 11. 27. was of the ſame ſtamp: that Saint <hi>Johns</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the new birth, is ſet forth by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral faith, <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is borne of God,</hi> 1. Joh. 5. To the ſolving of this doubt a double anſwer may be given. Firſt, that in thoſe times, the difficulty lay rather upon the <hi>aſſent</hi> then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>affiance,</hi> and the queſtion then was more about the perſon of Chriſt, then the office of Chriſt. Now becauſe it was a great matter in the firſt dawnings of the Goſpel to beleeve him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe outward appearance was ſo meane and contemptible to the eye of the world; therefore doth the Scripture much magnifie and heighten this act.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though the Scripture-expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions do lay much upon this one act of faith, yet do they not exclude, but ſuppoſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of faith to be joyned with it. To a true beleeving there are three acts neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115728:73"/> Knowledgr, Aſſent, Fiducial application; but yet the Scripture doth oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe faith by one of theſe acts, <hi>Joh. 17. 3. This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> In knowledge there are couched and included the other two acts of faith, in which the powerful reception and embracing of Chriſt for ſalvation doth chiefly conſiſt. So when it is ſet forth by an aſſent unto the truths of the Goſpel, there is implyed not only a bare perſwaſion of the minde, but an affectionate cleaving and adherence of the heart unto the promiſes of God made in Chriſt, by which the ſoul of a beleever is fortified againſt deſpaire, which the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call belief of them doth not in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure expell or overcome. And therefore though the Papiſts do deride this ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and application of Chriſt, as a meere conceit, and unwarranted fancy; though formal profeſſors do careleſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, and take all to be well enough with them, as long as they do not queſtion what the Scripture reveales; yet muſt not any that look after the real enjoyment of comfort and peace from the promiſes, pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a generall aſſent, which is little
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115728:73"/> worth; but muſt endeavour to cleare and evidence their peculiar intereſt in Chriſt and his promiſes, by a fiducial application of them unto themſelves.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 2. Rule. 2.</hi> Pore not on the meaſure of Humiliation.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond Cautionary Rule is to take heed of <hi>poring too much upon the meaſure and degrees of humiliation;</hi> as if there were any certain and regular ſtandard by which all humiliation muſt be meaſured, before ever we may juſtly claime an intereſt in the promiſes, or ſo much as put forth an hand to touch the hem of Chriſts garment, that our bloody iſſues may be healed. True it is, that the invitation which Chriſt makes <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. is only to them that labour and are heavy-laden, to come unto him, that he may give them reſt; becauſe they do beſt taſte the ſweetneſſe, and prize the happy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of an heavenly reſt and peace. But yet all whom Chriſt invites to come to him, are not alike burthened with the weight and preſſure of their ſinnes, or do equally labour under the ſenſe of Gods wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Some are not onely heavy-laden with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115728:74"/> their ſinnes, but have their bones broken with the weight of them, ſo as that they roare by reaſon of the continual diſquietneſſe of their heart. Others though they walk mournfully under their ſins, yet are not bowed down under ſo great a weight, nor expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch loud and paſſionate complaints. True it is, that Chriſt as a Phyſician goes onely to the ſick, and not to the whole, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 31. But yet all are not afflicted with the ſame violence, though all be ſick of the ſame diſeaſe. Some are ſo affected as that for a ſeaſon they ſeeme to lie under the <hi>Calenture</hi> and rage of deſpaire it ſelf. Others again are ſick of their ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a more milde and gentle manner: like to an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged ſtomach, they loath what before they loved: the iniquities that before they ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down with delight they vomit up in their confeſſion to God, and acknowledge them to be full of nothing but bitterneſſe. But yet weariſome nights through the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paines of a guilty and ſtung conſcience, are not appointed unto them: they lie down upon the bed of ſorrow, but not upon the rack of horror. Now the ground of this wide difference that is between the children of God in their firſt converſion and turning
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115728:74"/> unto himſelf, doth chiefly ariſe from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the liberty which he is pleaſed to take unto himſelfe in the effecting of his counſells and purpoſes. For God being a moſt voluntary agent, doth not tie himſelf to a like certaine and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered conſtancy in the time, meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his working upon his children; but being free and wiſe, without limit, and above meaſure, doth much diverſifie ſometimes the duration and continuance of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſorrow, by making the darkneſſe in ſome to be ſhorter, &amp; in others to be longer. Sometimes he differenceth the meaſure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the pangs and throwes of the new birth to be in ſome both few and eaſie; in others to be many and full of extremity. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he alters the moſt uſual manner of his working, in proportioning ſin and ſorrow to each other, and doth not make the terrours and affrightments for ſin to be parallel to the hainouſneſſe of the rebellions that have been perſiſted in againſt himſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is from heaven ſmitten with trembling, and aſtoniſhment, ſo as that for three dayes he ſees neither the light of the ſun, nor taſtes ought of any food, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 9. But, <hi>Zaccheus</hi> a Publican &amp; extortioner, is not ſtricken from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115728:75"/> the tree upon which he climbes to behold Chriſt by any raies of maieſty, and dread ſhining from his face upon him; but is like ripe fruit gathered by the hand, not ſhaken off by a tempeſtuous winde. By a ſoft and milde voyce that may allure and not affright, he is called to come down, to entertaine him who brought ſalvation unto his houſe, <hi>Luke.</hi> 19. 5. But yet both theſe, though by much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meanes, are effectually brought home to Chriſt, and made partakers of life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by him.</p>
                  <p>This cautionary direction is given, not as an encouragement to any to ſlight the neceſſity of humiliation, as if they might without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and brokenneſſe of heart for their ſins intereſt themſelves in Chriſt and his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, and in one moment leap out of the dregs and lees of their naturall corruption (on which they have been long ſettled) into an eſtate of purity and bleſſedneſſe; but it is chiefly for theſe three ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to direct ſuch as mourne under the ſenſe of their ſinnes that are of a deep and double die, to look more to the <hi>quality</hi> of their humiliation then to the <hi>quantitie,</hi> and to trie it rather by the touch-ſtone then to weigh it by the <hi>balance,</hi> becauſe it is not the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115728:75"/> meaſure, but the truth of it that makes it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Mariner in a calme may ſometimes apprehend as certain ruine to befal him, as in a ſtorm: and ſo a ſinner may ſee himſelf in a loſt and forlorne condition, out of Chriſt, though he be not broken with the fierce tempeſt of Gods diſpleaſure; but by more gentle, yet powerful convictions of the Spirit made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the abſolute neceſſity of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to free him from the maledictions of the law, and to reſtore him to an eſtate of happineſſe. Humiliation, as it is Gods work, ſo the meaſure of it is of his ordering and appointing, and in it deals as a wiſe Phyſician, who doth not give the like doſis or quantitie of Phyſick to every Patient; but what may beſt fit the ſtrength and conſtitution of him that is to receive it; or like the prudent huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman whom God hath inſtructed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, who doth not uſe the ſame threſhing inſtrument to beate out the more tender grain, which he doth to the hard. <hi>The cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel is not turned about upon the cummin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the fitches are beaten out with a ſtaffe, and the cummin with a rod, Iſay</hi> 28. 27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to acquaint ſuch whoſe, former wickedneſs of life hath been full of notoreity in many reiterated backſlidings from God,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115728:76"/> and rebellions againſt him; &amp; yet have paſſed through the pangs of the new birth without thoſe extremities that uſually are meaſured forth to great ſinners, to walk humbly with their God, and to make up what hath been wanting in the <hi>intenſion</hi> of their ſorrow, in the <hi>extenſion</hi> and continuance of it; often bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remembrance the foulneſſe of thoſe iniquities which might have made far greater rents, and more gaſtly wounds in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences then ever they ſuſtained, had not God varied his wonted way and method in which he walketh towards refractorie and obſtinate ſinners, making their agonie and paines to be proportionable to the hainouſeneſſe of their pollutions. They which pay ſmall fines, do commonly ſit at the greater rent: And thoſe Chriſtians who obtaine their peace &amp; recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God upon more eaſie and cheap termes then others do, and muſt expect that it will coſt them more to preſerve it, and to keep it from ſuſpitions and doubts about the truth of it, then uſually it doth thoſe, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of whoſe peace have been laid in a through and moſt deep work of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to antidote and relieve weak and tempted Chriſtians againſt their own feares
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115728:76"/> and Satans wilie ſuggeſtions, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mingled with thoſe complaints, which they poure forth concerning their unmeetneſs to take hold of the promiſes of mercy, and to apply the ſalvation of Chriſt unto themſelves. Gladly they would that their ſouls might be refreſhed with the leaſt drop of the comforts of the promiſes, with which others are filled, that they might but touch the garment of Chriſt, into whoſe ſides and wounds others do put their hands, crying out with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> But alas! they dare not do it. What is in others a duty, would be in them a preſumption for to do. What others are invited to do, they apprehend they are commanded to forbeare, in regard they have not yet undergone ſuch ſhakings and batterings by the law, as they have heard, read and knowne to be in others farre leſſe ſinners then themſelves. Now the ground of ſuch feares and miſgivings, as keep off the ſoule from cloſing with Chriſt and his promiſes, doth chiefly ariſe from their heeding more the meaſure of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the truth of it, and the aſcribing of the ſaving property in it, rather to the <hi>quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> then to the <hi>quality.</hi> But all humiliation for ſinne is then ſaving when true; and then
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115728:77"/> true, when it drives a ſinner utterly out of himſelf, and ſtirres up a vehement thirſting after Chriſt, and a ſettled reſolution to cleave wholly to him as his Lord and Saviour; as his King, to exerciſe his juſt ſoveraignty over him; as his Prieſt, to mediate unto God for him. And for all other ſteps or degrees of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, which troubled ſouls too often look upon as neceſſary and due qualifications to fit them for their drawing neer unto, and embracing of Chriſt and his promiſes; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting after ſuch a number of throwes, ſuch a meaſure, height, and continuance of ſorrow, to finde themſelves neerer unto him then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They are herein me-thinks not much unlike thoſe fooliſh children, who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the ſeeming ſloaping of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, do ſtrongly fancy that if they were but on the top of ſuch an hill, or ſuch a tree, then they might play with the ſunne, put out the ſtarres with their ſticks, and diſcover what kinde of man he is that dwells in the moone; but when they have throughly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in running thither, they finde the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to be at as great a diſtance from them, and as farre out of their reach as at firſt. So after all their moſt bitter lamentations for ſinne, they will at length finde that a preciſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115728:77"/> adequation between ſinne and ſorrow can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be attained unto, it being abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſufficiently to mourne for any one ſinne according to its juſt merit. <hi>Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs invenies eos qui innocentiam ſervave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quàm qui congruam egerunt poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:</hi> You may ſooner (ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> out of <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) finde thoſe who have kept their innocency unſpotted, then you can finde any that have bemoaned their ſins with a meet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

                  <p>The third Cautionarie direction is, To take heed of <hi>obſerving &amp; eying the providences of God above his promiſes;</hi> ſo as to build the foundation of our confidence upon them when ſucceſſeful; or when croſs and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115728:78"/> to weaken the expectation of faith in the fulfilling of any good which the promiſe as a ground of hope doth hold forth unto us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, believers are to be cautious of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the moſt ſucceſſefull providences the ground of their faith or hope, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the promiſes which are the only firme pillar upon which every believer may ſafely found his prayers in the ſeeking, and his confidence in the obtaining of any good that he asketh at Gods hands. This Caution is the more neceſſarie in regard, that in theſe times, multitudes of profeſſors do highly magnifie the providence of God, and uſe it as the onely argument to perſwade both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, that their wayes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are both moſt pleaſing unto God, who by a ſucceſſion of many wonderfull providences doth effect their untertakings for them in the midſt of many intervening difficulties. But they ſeldom or never make any mention of the promiſes, either as the light by which their wayes are directed, or as the ſpring from whence their encouragments and comforts flow and ariſe. Yea, oftentimes when they are at a loſſe in the Word, and cannot finde the leaſt footſtep in it which may allow or juſtifie the paths they walk in; they then

But as the providences of God are not to be neglected or undervalued by Chriſtians being full of deep and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſdome; ſo are they warily to be uſed as a ſingle light and evidence for the putting of men upon great undertakings, or to be the onely Cynoſure for their direction and guidance in them. The <hi>ſtarre-light</hi> of one ſingle <hi>promiſe</hi> is of more uſe to Chriſtians, then a <hi>conſtellation</hi> of many <hi>providences,</hi> both to aſſure them in their wayes, and to ſupport them under any difficulties that they may meet with, as may appeare in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the light and evidence which ariſeth from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> promiſe, is far more clear then the light of providence; and therefore more meet both to direct and comfort believers that look unto it, and ſeek an eſtabliſhment of their wayes from it. The promiſe is written in faire and capitall letters, which thoſe that are of the loweſt rank in knowledge and wiſdome may eaſily read and diſcerne. It makes wiſe the ſimple, and being pure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth the eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115728:79"/> of God are written in darke and unlegible characters, which though they may ſoone be diſcerned to be his hand, yet to deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher the ſenſe and meaning of them, is a task that oft times exceedeth the line of humane wiſdome. They are like the hand-writing upon the wal, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5. where part of the hand that wrote it <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſaw, but the meaning of it neither he nor the moſt learned of his Caldeans could finde out. To interpret the mind of God in his providences requires the skill and wiſdome of a <hi>Daniel</hi> who was filled with an excellent ſpirit of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but to know his will in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is enough if a man be a <hi>Nathanael,</hi> an Iſraelite in whom there is no guile; the path of them is plaine, and wayfaring men though fools, ſhall not erre therein, <hi>Iſa. 35. 8. Providences</hi> God uſeth as his <hi>Ciphers</hi> many times to hide his ſecret and his counſells from the eyes of men; but the promiſes are alwayes as his <hi>Letters of love,</hi> in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales himſelf unto believers, and acquaints them both of his peculiar love and care to them, and of their dutie and obligation unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the promiſes do exceed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty the moſt conſtant diſpenſations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115728:79"/> 
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>The tenure by which any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are given, and to which we are intitled only by providence, is not ſo firme and ſure, as that which is derived unto us by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. By the one we are made no better then tenants at will and at the diſcretion of their Lord, who though he let them enjoy rich poſſeſſions and revenues, may yet at his own pleaſure reſume them, and take all into his own hands; by the other we are made heirs of all the good things that are given unto us, and ſo may plead the promiſe of God as our right, they being a part of that portion which he as a Father is pleaſed to beſtow upon us for our more comfortable ſubſiſſtance in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pilgrimage. Oh! how ſlippery then is the foundation of thoſe mens comforts, which is only built upon the diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and not upon the ſtability of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? How unſound are their evidences which altogether ſtand in the ſucceſſe of their atchievements, &amp; in the proſperity that hath followed them in all their paths, which may in one moment be turned into a ſad change, having the ſame hand of providence which was wide opened in its bounty to them, lifted up in its diſpleaſure againſt them.</p>
                  <p>3ly. The promiſe exceeds providence in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115728:80"/> purity and ſweetneſſe that it derives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes to every externall mercie, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it are not freed from that vexation and vanity which ſinne hath ſubjected every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto. Providence diſpenſeth bleſſings, but the promiſe only ſanctifies them: the one gives the poſſeſſion of them, &amp; the other the true fruition of them. This is that which makes a wide difference between the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mercies which believers enjoy, and thoſe which wicked men do oft-times partake of in greater abundance from the hand of God. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath, is better then the riches of many wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37. 16. His drie morſels are ſweeter then their dainties, his ſmall pittance is more ſatisfactorie then their plentie. For the wicked have all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and inferiour things only <hi>ex largitate donantis,</hi> from the meere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> generall bounty of God, which doth not remove the incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the vacuity and vexation that are entailed upon them by ſinne: But the righteous hath the ſame things given unto him <hi>virtute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> by the right of a promiſe, which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the gifts of common providence, and taketh away from the creature that curſe wherin it was wrapped through the ſin of the <hi>firſt Adam.</hi> While therefore men pleaſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115728:80"/> themſelves in the ſingle intereſt and right of providence to their earthly comforts, &amp; look not unto the conveyance of them by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; it is no wonder if they become ſnares, toiles and thornes unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they complain that the ſtreams of their abundance are like the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> Exod. 15. 23. ſo bitter as that they cannot drink of them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they want Chriſt who is the onely tree of life for to heale them, and to change their unpleaſing bitterneſſe into a delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweetneſſe by the power of his Word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Believers are to be cautious that they weaken not the expectation of faith in the performance of any good, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth hold forth unto them, by making the providences of God that ſeeme to croſſe the fulfilling, of it, to be moving arguments to incline them to doubting or diffidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the truth of it. When <hi>Jacob</hi> underſtood that his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> was coming againſt him with four hundred men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. he doth not diſtruſt the promiſe that God had made unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. but he ſtrongly pleades it as a ground for his deliverance: <hi>Thou ſaidſt I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the ſea, which cannot be

When God by a dreame that was doubled on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to confirme the certainty of the thing, had revealed unto <hi>Joſeph</hi> the future honour and greatneſſe which he would exalt him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to above his brethren, cauſing their ſheaves to bow to his ſheaf, and the ſunne, moon, and the eleven ſtarres to make obeyſance unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 7, 9. The meanes that God uſeth for the effecting and bringing to paſſe his decree, not the concurrence of ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſmiling providences; but of ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which to the eye of reaſon ſeeme rather to deſtroy the promiſe, then to accompliſh it. Who could ever have conceived that the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him into a dry pit, the ſelling of him to the Iſhmaelite merchants, the putting of him into priſon and fetters by <hi>Potiphar,</hi> as a ſhameful offendor, ſhould lead to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> &amp; not to his ruine? Can light ſpring out of darkneſs, glory out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, liberty out of thraldome? And yet by ſuch ſtops as theſe doth God raiſ up <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the throne of honour: <hi>Untill the time that his word came, the word of the Lord tried him</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) Pſal.</hi> 105. 19. That is, until the very accompliſhment of the promiſe he was tried in the expectation of it, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115728:81"/> and ſore afflictions, in all which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a meaſure of faith and patience, as not to murmur or repine at the diſpenſations of God towards him, or faint in his waiting quietly for the fulfilling of the word which the Lord had ſpoken unto him. <hi>The archers ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him, but his bowe abode in ſtrength, and the armes of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of</hi> Jacob. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 23, 24 Therefore when believers do at any time finde the diſpenſations of God to them in his providences, to croſs rather then to favor the fulfilling of ſuch promiſes as he hath made to them in his Word, and which they in their prayers do earneſtly ſeek and expect; yet are they not to caſt away their confidence, or to take up any ſuch ſad concluſions, as that God hath forgotten his promiſe and that he beares no reſpect to them, or their ſacrifices; becauſe God doth not limit the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his promiſes, to the ſerenity and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his providences, but doth many times uſe ſuch diſpenſations, which ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fruſtrate and make void his purpoſe, then to eſtablſh and effect it. <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſet on ſhore by a whale, when the mariners arive at their Port by the ſhip.

                  <p>The fourth cautionary direction to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is, To <hi>take heed of a ſinful and affected cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſo as to eſteeme onely thoſe promiſes moſt precious, which do ſtand in the Scripture like fruit ungathered and untouched by the hand of common Chriſtians;</hi> and are like flowers (as they imagine) not at all ſmelt and blown upon by any but themſelves. As there is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115728:82"/> a vaine affectation in ſome Miniſters to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and wave thoſe Scriptures that have in them the greateſt pregnancy to confirm their doctrines, and to ſet their wits on work, and the texts many times upon the rack to force them to ſpeak to their purpoſe; that ſo their notions and conceptions may be looked upon by their auditors, as neither vulgar nor common: So is there a luſt of fancy in many Chriſtians of pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting themſelves in the picking and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting out ſuch promiſes, as have not come under the obſervation of others; or have been leaſt uſed by them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant daily recourſe which they have had unto them. Now this vanity and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity which thus prevailes in many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doth not only ſpring from pride, which often begets an affectation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; but it ariſeth alſo from a falſe conceit and opinion taken up by them, that ſuch promiſes are more <hi>ſweet</hi> when rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more <hi>full</hi> when ſucked on, being like unto breaſts that have had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or none of their milk drawn and taken from them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they conceive them to be more <hi>ſweet,</hi> and to affect the ſoul with a greater
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115728:83"/> of delight. But there is a twofold ſweetneſſe and delight: the one ariſeth from the <hi>goodneſse</hi> of the object; the other from the <hi>newneſse</hi> of the object. The newneſſe of the object is that with which fancy is chiefly delighted, and by which it worketh upon the will to cloſe with it, as a convenient and ſuitable good. But the underſtanding propounds the goodnes &amp; truth of the object to the will, and thereby draws and wins i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>o a liking and full embracing of it. Now that which ſhould endeare the promiſe unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, is not any ſuggeſtion from fancy that none but themſelves have either obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or uſed this or that particular promiſe; &amp; upon that ground to hug it in their boſoms, as Scholars do thoſe notions and books which none are poſſeſſed of but themſelves. But the high eſtimation which they have of them, ſhould wholly ariſe from that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent goodneſſe and truth which is in the promiſes, and makes them deſervedly to be of all deſired and accepted. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> commends the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. This is a faithful ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They conceive (though fondly) them to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115728:83"/> more <hi>full,</hi> as well as more ſweet. But this is one of the peculiar excellencies of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that the emanations of comfort which flow from them, are not in the leaſt impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or diminiſhed by the common and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of them; no more then light is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the Sunne by the multitudes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations that have enjoyed the uſe and benefit of it. Still it hath as much light in the body of it, as it had in its firſt creation. And ſo the promiſes which <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and all the faithful deſcended from them, have ſucceſſively uſed, and lived upon, do ſtill retaine the ſame vigour, and abound with as great plenty of ſupport and comfort unto preſent beleevers, as ever they did unto them. As the Bee doth with an innocent theft, as <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> calls it, ſuck honey from the flowers, without the leaſt prejudice to their beautiful colours which delight the eye, or to the fragrant ſent which affects the ſmell of him that gathers them: So do beleevers draw from the promiſes a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſatiety both of delight and comfort, without the leaſt diminution either of their fulneſſe or ſweetneſſe. He that is laſt in the application of the ſame promiſe, may finde it as rich in its plenty, as effectuall in its vigor,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115728:84"/> as he that came firſt unto it. Wells, ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> are the better, and more pure, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they be drawne; and ſo the promiſes (which are the <hi>wells of ſalvation</hi>) do receive an improvement by the frequent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>The end of this Caution is no way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any Chriſtians valuing or eſteem of one particular promiſe above others, which God by the powerfull workings of his Spirit hath in a ſpeciall manner made uſe of for the quieting of their ſoules in the time of their greateſt perplexity, and the filling of them with all joy &amp; peace in believing; as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did derogate ought from the juſt worth of other promiſes. For it being Gods manner not to ſeale and manifeſt his love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers by one and the ſame promiſe; but to make uſe of this promiſe to one, and of a differing promiſe to another, who both lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame diſtreſs. It is their duty to have in a peculiar remembrance that promiſe and Scripture above others, by which God was pleaſed firſt to ſpeak peace to their ſoules. But the aime of the Caution is to keep believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from putting any diſreſpect upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, by their eſteeming of them to be ſo much the leſſe worth, by how much the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115728:84"/> more common and ordinary they have been in their uſe. Did <hi>Manna</hi> nouriſh the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites the leſſe, becauſe it was their uſual food in the Wilderneſſe, or <hi>Quailes</hi> the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a new kinde of meat? The one indeed pleaſed their appetite and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late more, but the other ſupplied their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities as well. And ſo the promiſes which are moſt obvious and common in their uſe, do yield to Chriſtians as much reall and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid comfort when rightly applied; though others which they conceive to have been leſſe obſerved, or by themſelves onely taken notice of, may more affect, and pleaſe the curioſity of a luſtful fancy.</p>

                  <p>The fifth Cautionary direction is to <hi>take heed of carnal reaſonings,</hi> which are reſtleſſe in their enmity to all matters that appertain to faith, or at the beſt full of impotency and unable to yield any aſſiſtance to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, carnal reaſon is unwearied in its oppoſing and contradicting of faith, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115728:85"/> of all graces hath the moſt immediate rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the promiſes, and is of greateſt uſe in the application of them. It is an enemy to the firſt implantation of it, and hinders men from ſubmitting to the righteouſneſſe of God, by poſſeſſing their mindes with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt prejudices and cavils againſt his Word. God ſaith that <hi>his words do good to them that walk uprightly, Mich.</hi> 2. 7. But the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of carnal men is: <hi>It is vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances? Mal.</hi> 3. 14. Chriſt ſaith that <hi>his yoke is eaſie, and his burden light, Mat.</hi> 11. 30. But his carnal diſciples cry out, <hi>It is an hard ſaying, and who can heare it? Joh.</hi> 6. 60. God ſaith, his waves are juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual: But the carnal Iſraelites are not afraid to cenſure his as crooked and their own as ſtrait, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33. 17. And as by the diſguiſes, and artifices of carnal reaſon men are kept from an happy change of their natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate by beleeving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So when faith is wrought, they are by the enmity of the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple continually diſquieted, and interrupted in the comfortable enjoyment of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bleſſed priviledges which they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed in by faith. Sometimes it calls into queſtion their title to what they poſſeſſe, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115728:85"/> ſuggeſts unto them, that they are rather preſumptuous intruders, then juſt proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; that the evidences upon which they build their hopes, are the deluſions, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatteries of their own hearts and not the unerring teſtimony of Gods Spirit. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it raiſeth jealouſies concerning the promiſes themſelves, that they are things as eaſily revoked, as they are made, which though they yield preſent comfort, yet do not aſcertaine any future ſecurity; that though God turne not away from them, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his love, yet they may turne from him and ſo nullifie the promiſes, and the Covenant of his mercy unto themſelves. It is therefore of great concernment unto beleevers in the making uſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to be cautious in admitting the pleas and arguments of carnal reaſon, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſo often <hi>anſwered,</hi> will never be <hi>ſilent.</hi> But peremptorily to reſolve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, notwithſtanding all that ſenſe and reaſon can ſuggeſt to the contrary. <hi>To wink and beleeve,</hi> to ſhut their eyes againſt all difficulties; and when they are ſo great as to poſe their reaſon, not to let them to poſe their faith. Excellent is that ſaying of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Aperuit nobis in Paradiſo oculos Satan,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115728:86"/> nunc omnis labor in eo nobis eſt, ut eos iterum claudamus &amp; obturemus.</hi> In Paradiſe Satan firſt opened our eyes, and now it is our chiefe labour to ſhut and faſt cloſe them again, that ſo we may no more be betrayed by them. Senſe and reaſon being in the things of faith, <hi>noxiabeſtia,</hi> an harmfull beaſt (as he calls it) to overturne, and deſtroy whatever faith uſeth as a prop to reſt it ſelfe upon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as Carnall reaſon is an enemie unto faith; ſo at the beſt it is full of impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and unable to give the leaſt aſſiſtance to believers in their making uſe of the promiſes, or dijudication of ſpirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as may appeare in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is <hi>dimme-ſighted, and wants a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive faculty.</hi> Buſie and curious it is in prying &amp; looking into the myſteries of faith; but altogether weak and unskilful in making any true judgement concerning them. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is like the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> which is reported to be of quick-ſight on the land, but of dull ſight on the water: It is ſagacious in earthly things, but hath no inſight in ſpirituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>Aſaph</hi> attempted by the diſcuſſions of reaſon, to have found out the ground of Gods differing adminiſtrations towards his people,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115728:86"/> and the men of the world, whoſe bellies were filled whith hid treaſure, but he was by his own confeſſion ſoon at a loſſe: <hi>When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me, Pſ.</hi> 73. 16. And when he did go that way to ſatisfie himſelfe, how oppoſite is the inference and concluſion to that which he makes upon a ſecond view, and lookes upon the ſame things by the light of the lamp of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary? When he beholds Gods diſpenſations with the eye of his reaſon onely, what a wilde and erroneous concluſion doth he take up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Verily, I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands ininnocency, ver.</hi> 13. But when he comes to read them over again by the eye of faith, then he draws a right inference from the premiſſes, <hi>It is good for me to draw neer to God, verſe</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>And as reaſon is blinde in diſcerning ſpirituall objects, ſo is it alſo <hi>unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in the uſe of thoſe meanes by which faith is enabled to make a full &amp; perfect diſcovery of them. Reaſon is like unto a man that takes the wrong end of the perſpective glaſs to ſee, with which leſſeneth the magnitude of the object, and increaſeth the diſtance. It looketh upon the promiſes by unapt <hi>mediums,</hi> which do not make a juſt repreſentation of them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115728:87"/> and therefore diſcernes little or nothing of their reality, and exiſtence: but faith that looketh at the right end of the glaſſe, which being more full of light, doth multiply the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and thereby takes away the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the objects, and preſents them as cloſe unto the eye. Thus <hi>Abraham ſaw Chriſts day and rejoyced to ſee it, Joh.</hi> 8. 56. Great was the ſpace of time between the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that promiſe, and the fulfilling of it unto <hi>Abraham, that in him all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12. 3. But yet his faith eying the power and truth of God that made it, looks upon the long intervall of many ages that was between him and his promiſed ſeed, as upon a very ſmall and inconſiderable diſtance. Thus the holy Patriarchs did not only ſee the promiſes afar off, but they alſo ſaluted and embraced them as neare: they were in regard of their own exiſtence afarre off; but in regard of their faith they were hard at hand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Carnal reaſon, as it is blinde, ſo is it alſo <hi>full of impatience,</hi> and therfore unmeet to be an aſſiſtance unto faith. The Apoſtle tells the believing Hebrewes, that <hi>they have need of patience that after they have done the will of God, they might receive the promiſe, Heb.</hi> 10. 36.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115728:87"/> It is ſo neceſſarie a grace for Chriſtians, as that without patience we can ſcarce be men, much leſs Chriſtians. The difficulties that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are to wreſtle with, are neither few nor ſmall; but ſharp, long, and numerous; all which muſt be endured with patience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can reap the promiſe. Though the end be a throne of glory, a crowne of life, yet the way is a way of blood: though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be ſure, yet the waiting for it is long. Now carnall reaſon is full of impatience, it can neither wait the time, nor endure the trials which muſt be undergone. It likes well of the end, but not of the way; it affects the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the promiſe; but it cannot ſtay the appointed time. Thus the Iſraelites gladly embraced the firſt ridings of their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance brought unto them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and with bowed heads worſhipped the Lord, who had looked upon their afflictions, <hi>Ex.</hi> 4. 31 yet could they not with patience for a few days quietly wait the Lords ſeaſon. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deales more hardly with them then before, and now all their hopes of liberty are at an end; &amp; they complaine unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they were ſo farre from deliverance, as that he <hi>had made them to be abhorred in the eyes of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and in the eyes of his ſervants, and had put a ſword in their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115728:88"/> hands to ſlay them, Exod.</hi> 5. 21. And though <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to comfort them a ſecond time, &amp; to aſſure them that the day of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was at hand; yet <hi>for anguiſh of ſpirit they hearkned not unto him, Exod.</hi> 6. 9. Senſe &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do make deaf the ears of believers to what ever God ſpeaks to ſupport them in their trouble, &amp; makes them as unfit to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impreſſion from the promiſe, as water is to take the ſimilitude and character of the ſeale, which is as ſoone loſt as made. It lookes upon a few dayes as ſo many yeares, and a few yeares as ſo many ages: and is therefore moſt unmeet to deale in any matters that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, carnall reaſon is <hi>full of ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe fears</hi> and jealouſies, apt to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by denials, ready to faint upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the leaſt difficulties; and therefore unable to contribute any aſſiſtance unto faith, whoſe peculiar work &amp; art it is to look from and above thoſe impediments which reaſon ſtumbles at. Faith is a moſt venturous grace, which walketh upon thoſe deep ſeas with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that the line of reaſon cannot fathome; when it like unto a young ſwimmer dares go no further, then it can feel the bottom. Faith gathers reſolution from denials and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115728:88"/> repulſes; like unto the wheel in the water which being driven from it by the ſtream, returnes upon it with the greater violence. When reaſon ſits down diſconſolate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd ſaith, All pleadings and ſtrivings are in vaine. Thus the woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi> 15. from the <hi>ſilence</hi> of Chriſt, from the <hi>denials</hi> of Chriſt, from his <hi>calling</hi> of her dog, findes ground to continue her ſuit. When he is ſilent, and anſwers not, then there is hope, becauſe he denies not. When he denies her, then there is more hope, becauſe he ſpeakes, and may quickly be entreated, though at preſent he deny. When he calls her dog, then her hope ariſeth higher, becauſe though the children only muſt be full fed; yet ſurely he will not let the dogs to ſtarve. Faith is a grace which in the greateſt exigencies &amp; ſtraits that can befal a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believer loſeth nothing of its courage and magnanimity, but chearfully beares up in the midſt of all. When reaſon is at a loſſe through the multiplicity of feares, and diſtractions with which it is filled; the one is like to the <hi>timorous Paſſenger</hi> in a ſtorme at ſea, who makes it his only work to tell the waves, and to ſhreek at the beating of every billow againſt the ſhip; the other is like the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115728:89"/> 
                     <hi>induſtrious Pilot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who hath <hi>manum ad clavum, et oculum ad coelum,</hi> his hand to the helme, and his eye to heaven, and minds more his duty, then his danger. Thus <hi>Habakkuk, When the fig-tree bloſſomes not, nor fruit is found on the vine: when the labour of the olive faileth, and the fields yield no meat: when the flock is cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the ſtalls;</hi> reſolves in the midſt of ſo derne a winter, and ſeaſon of ſcarcity, not onely to exerciſe pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but joy, and to <hi>rejoyce in the God of his ſalvation, Habak.</hi> 3. 17, 18. Thus <hi>Job</hi> is in the divine record as famous for his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as for his patience, which in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with God himſelf he will not let go; <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him, Job.</hi> 13. 15. though he breath out his life, yet ſhall not his hope expire with it. Oh! therefore let Chriſtians, when they are to act faith in the promiſes, take heed of the ſuggeſtions of carnall reaſon, and learne to do as they who levell at a mark, are uſed to do, who cloſe one eye, that they may take aime the better with the other: ſhut faſt the eye of deprayed reaſon, that they may ſee the more clearly with the eye of faith.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 1. Cau. 6.</hi> Take heed of groundleſſe fancies concerning the manner of receiving Comfort.</head>
                  <p>The ſixth Cautionary direction is, to take heed of <hi>groundleſs and wild fancies concerning the manner of receiving comfort,</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment from the promiſes, ſo as to expect that the conſolations which come from them, muſt be adminiſtred rather by the hand of an <hi>Angel,</hi> then of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and witneſſed by ſome voice from heaven, then by the cleare teſtimony of the Word: and if they come not attended with ſuch pompe and ſtate, then to look upon them as common, and ordinary comforts; but not as evidences that have a ſufficiency of glory and luſtre to confirme
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115728:90"/> the ſoul in the love of God. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> the Aſſyrian came to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> to be cured of his leproſie, he onely ſent out a meſſenger unto him, who bade him go and waſh ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and fleſh ſhould come again unto him, and he ſhould be clean, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 10. But <hi>Naaman</hi> thought that the Prophet would have uſed more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to have wrought the cure: that he himſelf would have come out unto him, that he would ſtrike his hand on the place, and call on the Name of the Lord his God; And therefore departs in anger, as ſcorning the ſimplicity of the meanes which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him: So many Chriſtians when they lie under deep agonies and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of heart, and are counſelled to act faith upon the promiſes, to attend upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of the Goſpel in the Word, to wraſtle with God in prayer, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think that theſe are ſalves that may do well for common ſores; but their maladies are ſuch that unleſſe Chriſt touch them with his own hand, the vertue that comes from theſe things, as from his garments, can never heale them, unleſſe God do from heaven confirme his promiſes by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſignes, and miracles, their breaches and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115728:90"/> ruptures will never be healed, their comforts and peace will never prevaile againſt their feares and darkneſſe. It is not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſtaffe laid upon the face of the dead childe, that will bring life again into it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 32. he muſt come and ſtretch himſelfe upon the childe ere the fleſh of it will wax warme.</p>
                  <p>This Caution is the more neceſſary to be heeded, upon a double ground. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the aptneſſe that is in troubled Chriſtians to affect new meanes above the right, means, and to build their confidence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomething that is without the compaſſe of the Word, rather then upon the Word it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the great danger and deceit that is in thoſe extraordinary ways, by which many do pretend to have their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; aſſurance to be confirmed unto them, which in the uſe of all other means they could never find to be fully and ſatisfyingly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced unto them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a pronity in Chriſtians eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when exerciſed with fears, and doubts concerning their condition, to grow weary of uſing ſuch means in which they find not their expectations ſpeedily anſwered, &amp; through an over-haſty deſire of comfort to trie the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115728:91"/> of it in a new way, rather then to perſevere in the old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Being in this not much unlike to many weak and craſie Patients, that are more ready to fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every new medicine they heare off, and to tamper with it, then to expect a recovery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by going through a courſe of Phyſick preſcribed by the Phyſician. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells of a Religious Lady of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſes bed-chamber, whoſe name was <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goria,</hi> that being much troubled about her ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, did write unto him, that ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe importuning him, till he had ſent her word, that he had received a revelation from heaven that ſhe was ſaved. To whom he returned this anſwer: <hi>Rem difficilem poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, &amp; inutilem, &amp;c.</hi> That it was an hard, and altogether uſeleſſe matter which ſhe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him. It was difficult for him to obtaine, as being unworthy to have the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of God to be imparted unto him; and it was unprofitable for her to know, not onely for the reaſon which he aſſignes, that ſuch a revelation might make her too ſecure; but alſo becauſe it was impoſſible for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, and make known unto her, or any other the truth and infallibility of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he had received to be from God; ſo that had ſhe afterwards called into queſtion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115728:91"/> the truth of it, as well ſhe might, her troubles and doubtings concerning her ſalvation would have been as great as they were before. O therefore let believers that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the peace and love of God, take heed of relinquiſhing that more ſure word of Prophecy, which ſhines as a light in a darke place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and of flying unto viſions, revelations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> voices from heaven, to aſſure and evidence unto them their ſalvation, and to be the ſeales of the truth of thoſe comforts and joys, which they are filled with. Theſe are wayes that have more external glory and pomp in them; but the acting of faith on the promiſes, and the adhering of the ſoule unto thoſe truths declared in them, is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable way of obtaining a full eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heart in all ſound joy and peace; and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> (though as he confeſſeth,) he was often tempted to aske for ſignes, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, revelations from heaven to confirme him in his way, yet tells how ſtrongly he did withſtand them: <hi>Pactum feci cum Domino Deo meo, ne mihi mittat vel viſiones, vel ſomnia, vel e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iam Angelos. Contentus enim ſum hoc dono, quòd habeo Scripturam ſanctam, quae abundè do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet ac ſuppeditat omnia, quae neceſſaria ſunt, tum ad hanc vitam, tum ad futuram:</hi> I have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115728:92"/> (ſaith he) indented with the Lord my God, that he would never ſend me dreams, viſions, Angels; for I am well content with this gift, that I have the holy Scripture, which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teach and ſupply all neceſſaries for this life, and that alſo which is to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as there is an aptneſſe in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to affect ſuch extraordinary wayes, and means of comfort, ſo is there alſo no little danger and deceit in the wayes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are dangerous, in regard that they make the Word and promiſes to be as things of little value and eſteem, which ſhould be as the only ſacred Oracles of truth for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to have their recourſe unto. Such who cry up revelations, make it their practice to cry down the Word, and look upon thoſe that adhere to the Scriptures, and make them the touchſtone to try every ſpirit by, as <hi>Vocaliſtas, et Literatiſtas, Vowaliſts</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſts,</hi> having litle or no acquaintance with the deep things of God. Such who affirme aſſurance to be the immediate voice of the Spirit ſpeaking in them, &amp; ſaying unto them, that their ſinnes are forgiven them; how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully do they ſpeak of the certainty and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115728:92"/> perſwaſion which believers have from the gracious operations of the Spirit, and the bleſſed fruits of holineſſe wrought by him in their ſouls, which by his enlightening they are enabled to diſcern, &amp; thereby to be confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of Gods love unto them, and of their intereſt in all the promiſes? This they dignify with no better or higher title then an humane faith, then a conjectural knowledge, though the teſtimonie be truly ſupernaturall, both in regard of the efficient cauſe, and alſo of the meanes whereby they come to be thus perſwaded. Yea, though it be the only ſafe way which the Scripture holds out for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to trie their eſtates by, to look unto the effects and fruits of the Spirit of God in them, and not to any immediate voices or revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from heaven, as the teſtimonie of Gods love unto them; yet do ſuch vilifie this kinde of evidence as low and carnall, and altogether unmeet for Evangelical Chriſtians to make uſe of. What ſhould they need to have a ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſee by, when they may enjoy the ſunne which is the light of lights?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as they are dangerous, ſo are they full of deceit and illuſion. Young <hi>Samuel</hi> not acquainted with any extraordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115728:93"/> of the preſence &amp; power of God, took the voice of God from heaven to be the voice of old <hi>Eli, 1 Sam</hi> 3. 5. And ſo do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny take the irregular motions of their owne hearts to be the divine breathings, and the powerfull impulſes of the Spirit of God, wherby they are ſtirred up to the undertaking of ſundry actions which the Word in the leaſt meaſure countenanceth not. How frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe times do fanatick perſons baptize the violent workings of their own diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered fancies, with the name of the viſions of God, and of the raptures of the Spirit? How often doth Satan by transforming himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angel of light, endeavor the ſeducement and ruine of many Chriſtians, againſt whom as an Angel of darkneſſe he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile? being in every thing Gods Ape to imitate thoſe extraordinary wayes by which God hath ſometimes made known himſelf unto his people. <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his book <hi>de probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ſpirituum,</hi> of the triall of ſpirits, tells a remarkable ſtory of Satans appearing to an holy man in a moſt glorious and beautifull manner, profeſſing himſelf to be Chriſt, and becauſe he for his exemplary holineſſe was worthy to be honoured above others, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appeared unto him; but the old man
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115728:93"/> readily anſwered him, that he deſired not to ſee his Saviour in this wilderneſſe; it ſhould ſuffice him to ſee him hereafter in heaven, and with all added this pithy prayer, <hi>Sit in alio ſeculo, non in hoc, viſio tua merces mea</hi> O let thy ſight be my reward; Lord, in another life, and not in this life.</p>
                  <p>This direction therefore is of no little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance unto beleevers, that would not looſe and wilder themſelves in uncertainties both in regard of duty and comfort, to take heed how they leave the precept of the Word, and betake themſelves unto reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for rhe guidance of their wayes, or how they neglect the application of the promiſes by faith for the eſtabliſhing of their hearts in the peace and love of God, and expect their aſſurance to flow from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voice or dictate of the Spirit; as if the Word and promiſes had no activity and light in them, to evidence and declare the certainty and truth of theſe things unto their ſouls. Such wayes, though the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them may render them pleaſing to many, yet it cannot (as we ſee) make them ſafe to any that tread or walk in them. And therefore let that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> be every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians practice and prayer, <hi>Sint ſacrae Scripturae</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:115728:94"/> tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>SECT. 2. Cau. 7.</hi> Let not thy heart out on earthly Objects.</head>
                  <p>The ſeventh and laſt Cautionary directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, To <hi>take beed of having the heart let out to earthly objects,</hi> either in earneſt deſires after them, or in long and frequent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the minde upon them. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promiſes is then moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful and operative, when they lie near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and cloſeſt unto the ſoul; and the comforts that diſtill from them are then moſt ſweet, when they are received into the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the hidden man. The ſofteſt garments men uſually weare next their skin, and the beſt Jewels they lay up in the moſt inward cells of their Cabinets: And of ſuch a nature are the promiſes, and invitations of mercy in the Goſpel; they are things of the greateſt delicacy, and therefore ſhould be applied next unto the heart, which is of all parts the moſt tender: they are of the <hi>higheſt worth and value,</hi> and therefore ſhould <hi>higheſt</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:115728:94"/> be lodged in the <hi>moſt retired and inward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of the minde, as their <hi>moſt due and proper ſeate.</hi> All interpoſition of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things doth not onely hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance both of grace, and comfort from the promiſes, but doth alſo according to the meaſure &amp; predominancy of it make the heart as an unmeet veſſel to receive ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treaſure in diverſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, earthly things do <hi>fill</hi> the heart, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put it into an incapacity of receiving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine <hi>counſel</hi> or <hi>comfort</hi> from the Word or promiſes. They fill the heart with <hi>crouds of buſineſſes,</hi> ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Word finde no more place in it, then <hi>he and his mother did roome in the Inne,</hi> where the manger was fain to be his cradle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 7. They fill the heart with diverſity <hi>of cares and ſolicitudes;</hi> ſo that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not have any freedom to attend hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly duties. <hi>Martha</hi> who was troubled about many things, did not with <hi>Mary</hi> her ſiſter ſit at Chriſts feet to hear the Word, her cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about much ſerving, made her to neglect the <hi>one thing that was needfull, Luke.</hi> 10. 41. They many times fill the heart with <hi>pride and ſcorne,</hi> ſo as that the choiceſt things of the Goſpel are no better then fooliſhneſſe. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> heard <hi>Chriſt</hi> preach againſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115728:95"/> earthly affections, <hi>but they derided him, Luke. 16. 14. The full ſoul loatheth the honey-combe, Pro.</hi> 27. 7. and ſo doth an earthly minde reject the Word, which is more ſweet then the dropping honey.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, earthly things <hi>defile</hi> the heart with many <hi>vile and corrupt affections,</hi> which do unqualifie it for the reception of holy and precious promiſes. They ſtain the heart with an <hi>adulterous and impure love, which is enmity unto God James,</hi> 4. 4. and make it apt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer carnall ſatisfactions before communion with Chriſt. They defile the heart with a <hi>falſe and unſound confidence,</hi> turning it from God who is the ſole object of truſt, unto the mutable and unſtable creature: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> enjoynes <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>charge them that are rich in this world, that they truſt not in uncertain riches, but in the living God, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17. They pollute the heart <hi>with, ſenſuall joyes,</hi> with unhallowed pleaſures and delights, ſo that the joy of the corne, wine and oile increaſing doth extinguiſh that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and tranquillity of mind that flowes from the preſence and fruition of ſpirituall objects; as in luxurious perſons ſtrange love doth eate out and obliterate, that which is conjugall. How then can any
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115728:95"/> man expect, that the holy Spirit of promiſe ſhould be both a Counſellor and Comforter unto ſuch an one, whoſe love, confidence, joys, are adulterate and ſinfull? Surely he who hath the purity of a <hi>dove,</hi> will never take up the lodging of a <hi>crow:</hi> he who dwells in the ſoule when it is a temple of holineſſe, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afforde his preſence, when it is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a cage of uncleane birds.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, earthly objects <hi>divide</hi> the heart, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2. 10. and make it uncertain in its motions towards God. As the balance hath no ſtedfaſtneſſe in it ſelf, but doth by every breath and touch fluctuate, ſometimes to the one hand, ſometimes to the other: ſo the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind is various and inconſtant in its deſires to heavenly things; ſometimes for a ſhort and ſudden fit it ſeemes to affect them, and by and by growes cold and heartleſs again: Like to the graſſe-hoppers, which (as <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves) give a flirt up, and make a faint eſſay of flying towards heaven, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fall on the earth againe. Thus the young man, <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 17. comes <hi>running</hi> to Chriſt, to ſhew his fervour and zeal; <hi>kneels</hi> to him, to teſtifie his obſervance; <hi>prayes</hi> to him to direct him in the way to eternall life, to evidence his care and ſolicitude about it;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115728:96"/> but when Chriſt bids him <hi>to ſell whatſoever he had, and give to the poor, that ſo he might have treaſure in heaven;</hi> how ſoon doth he who ran, and kneeled, and prayed to Chriſt, turn his back upon him, &amp; go from him? How quickly are his <hi>deſires</hi> turned into <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and his <hi>prayer</hi> into a fearful <hi>apoſtaſie?</hi> Now then, if earthly things do make the heart thus unſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and unfaithful to God, how exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt they needs indiſpoſe it for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of grace, and comfort from God in all his promiſes; to the obtaining of which nothing is more requiſite then an evenneſs and conſtancy of the deſires in ſeeking after them, and an entireneſſe and oneneſſe of heart in laying hold on them? For as all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are one in Chriſt, and cannot be ſevered or parted, no more then lines in their common centre; ſo neither muſt the heart by which they are embraced be divided. Whole Chriſt and all his promiſes are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every believer, and are no otherwiſe diverſified then according to the exigence of mens preſent conditions, which ſometimes requires the application of one promiſe, and ſometimes of another: and therefore muſt the whole heart be given unto him again, or elſe we cannot ever expect to have
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115728:96"/> any intereſt in him or his bleſſed promiſes. True it is, that in the beſt of Chriſtians, there is found <hi>an unſtedfaſtneſſe</hi> of heart and affections, but it is not an unſtedfaſtneſſe in reſpect of the <hi>object,</hi> but onely in <hi>degrees.</hi> It is not ſuch as diſtracts the heart, and makes it to float between two different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but onely makes it unequall in its motions towards one and the ſame thing. As the bowle when it is firſt throwne out of the hand runs more ſwiftly towards the marke then it doth afterwards; but yet the tendency of the motion is the ſame, though the vigor and ſtrength of it be not alike: ſo believers, when partakers of ſome freſh gales of the Spirit, do then move towards Chriſt with more quick and lively affections then at other times; but yet by that inward principle of holineſſe that is within them, they are alwayes carried towards him in their deſires, though not after one equall and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme manner.</p>
                  <p>This Caution therefore, though it be the laſt, yet is it not the leaſt, which believers are with much diligence and circumſpection to obſerve, that would gladly be partakers of the ſpirituall riches and treaſures which are in the promiſes. But the end of it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115728:97"/> not, that we ſhould abandon all care and induſtry in our Callings; or that we ſhould affect a voluntary and Monkiſh poverty, as if there were an abſolute inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the having the bleſſings of this life, and the enjoyments of the other life: We may <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> earthly comforts; but we muſt not be <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> by them: We may uſe them as <hi>flowers</hi> to ſmell on; but not as <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> to crowne our ſelves with them: We may in our pilgrimage walk with them as <hi>ſtaves</hi> in our hands, ſeeking a countrey which is above; but we may not load our ſelves with them, and beare them as <hi>burthens</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our backs: We may make them our <hi>encouragements;</hi> but not our <hi>confidence:</hi> We may minde them as our <hi>acceſſories;</hi> but we may not love them, as our principal <hi>happineſſe.</hi> As bees, though they live in the midſt of their cells of honey and wax; yet have not their wings touched with any viſcuous matter, that may hinder their delightfull flight abroad, and their nimble paſſing from one flower to another: So ſhould Chriſtians that live in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of earthly comforts, as in an hive of ſweetneſſe, be exceeding carefull that nothing of the world do cleave to their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115728:97"/> affections, which are the wings of the ſoule, that may hinder the lifting and raiſing up of their he arts towards heavenly objects or abate the activity of their thoughts in their frequent muſings on the promiſes, and other myſteries of the Goſpell, on which the minde above all other things ought to be moſt exerciſed, and delighted.</p>
                  <p>I have now done with the third particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that in the entrance of this task was propounded to be handled, and have inſiſted longer upon every direction both poſitue and cautionary, then I firſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but my end was not to offend any by prolixity, but to render them more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary unto all, then otherwiſe they might have been if contracted into a leſſe and narrower compaſſe, and made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deſcription of a pitched field or bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wherein there are many heads and ſpeares painted, but few or no compleat and entire bodies.</p>

               <p>I Come now to the fourth particular, which doth conſiſt of divers Queries, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their reſolutions, the clear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of which will much facilitate the uſe and application of the promiſes. And the firſt Quere is,</p>
               <p>Whether the eſſence of ſaving and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith doth lie in a prevailing Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo as that he who truly believes, doth certainly know himſelf to have faith, and to believe on Chriſt?</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 1.</hi> Faith is not a full aſſurauce.</head>
                  <p>This queſtion I do the rather chuſe to ſpeak ſomewhat unto, in regard that many of our Divines have in their writings not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed between <hi>Fides, Fiducia,</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituda, Faith, Affiance,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> but
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115728:98"/> have promiſcuouſly treated of them, as if they were one and the ſame thing. Yea, ſundrie pious and learned men have defined faith to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>a full perſwaſion of the heart grounded on the promiſes of God, &amp;c.</hi> Now that which chiefly led them to give this definition of faith, was their zeale to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the certainty, and evidence of faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popiſh doubtings. But a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention will no more make a truth, then a faire marke will make a good ſhoote: For while on the one hand they have endeavoured to vindicate faith from that languor, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty unto which the Papiſts have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, they have on the other hand occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned great feares and perplexities to ariſe in the hearts of many tender and weak Chriſtians, who are apt to uſe this as an argument againſt themſelves, that they have no faith at all, becauſe they have no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at all. To keep therefore ſuch <hi>bruiſed reeds</hi> from being broken, and the <hi>ſmoking flax</hi> from being quenched under the ſenſe of their want of Aſſurance: I ſhall by ſundrie demonſtrations clearly ſhew, that the eſſence of ſaving faith doth not ſtand in a prevailing Aſſurance, that a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may have the one, and yet want the other.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:115728:99"/>
                  <p>The firſt ſhall be taken from that eſtate, and condition of men whom Chriſt the great Judge of all the world doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and declare to be bleſſed; and they are ſuch as are believers, becauſe all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe under the Goſpel cometh onely by faith: And this bleſſedneſſe ſtandeth in the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7. Yet their preſent condition ſpeaketh nothing leſſe then Aſſurance: <hi>Bleſsed are the poore in ſpirit,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 3. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne. ver.</hi> 4. And againe, <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, ver.</hi> 6. But ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall poverty, mourning, hunger, though they be Goſpel-graces which do ariſe from faith, are all together diſtinct from <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> as may appeare in their different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Aſſurance is <hi>riches,</hi> and not <hi>poverty. Coloſſ. 2. 2. joy,</hi> and not <hi>mournng. 1 John. 1. 4. ſatisfaction,</hi> and not <hi>hunger</hi> of <hi>want</hi> and emptineſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 14. So in that parable of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and the <hi>Publican</hi> going up into the temple to pray, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18. 10, 11. our Saviour tells us that the <hi>Phariſee</hi> was full of preſumption and falſe confidence; but the <hi>Publican</hi> through a ſenſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, was almoſt overwhelmed with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115728:99"/> feares and miſgivings of heart; he ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, and dares not draw neere, he is ſo full of ſhame as that he would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to heaven; He ſmites his breaſt, as pointing out the fountaine from whence all his miſery and ſinne did flow; He accuſeth himſelfe in his prayer as a great ſinner; In all his actions, geſtures, words there is no expreſſion of his aſſurance of pardon; and yet <hi>he went away juſtified,</hi> and not the other, which without faith he could not have been.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond demonſtration is from the <hi>ſtate of deſertion</hi> into which a believer may fall. A child of light may walk in darkneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and neither behold the <hi>ſun-light</hi> of Gods countenance, nor the <hi>ſtarre-light</hi> of his owne graces for many dayes. He may be as a tree in winter whoſe ſap is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the roote, and hath neither fruit nor leaves hanging on it to evidence that it is not dead. As in the ſufferings of Chriſt upon the croſſe, there was for a time <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractio viſionis,</hi> a withdrawing of the light of Gods countenance; but not <hi>diſſolutio vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> any breaking, or diſſolution of the Union: So in the derelictions that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is ſubject unto, there may be a <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:115728:100"/> in regard of the comfortable manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhining forth of the <hi>beames</hi> of Gods love; but no <hi>interruption</hi> in regard of his <hi>Union</hi> with Chriſt Thus it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. who begges the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the joy of Gods ſalvation,</hi> and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment <hi>of his free Spirit.</hi> And thus it was with <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88. who in his own apprehenſion was as one <hi>free among the dead, ver.</hi> 5. Thus it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> when lying in the belly of the whale, as in a grave, he ſaid, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight, Jonah</hi> 2. 4. But yet ſtill they were believers, and their faith was alive at the roote, neither was there any interciſion of their fellowſhip with Chriſt. Now if faith, when Aſſurance is loſt do continue as believers Union with Chriſt, it will alſo begin his Union with Chriſt, though it be not accompanied with Aſſurance. Or if a believer may loſe his Aſſurance, and yet not wholly loſe his ſaith, then may he alſo have faith before it do grow up into Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>A third demonſtration is taken from the differing ſtature and condition of believers. As in the world there are not onely <hi>aged men</hi> whoſe multitude of yeares do teach wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dom, and <hi>young men</hi> whoſe bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115728:100"/> moiſtened with marrow are full of ſtrength; but there are alſo <hi>infants</hi> which hang upon the breaſt of their mother, who though they enjoy life, yet do not know that they have life, or are able to reflect upon any action which they do: So in the Church there are not onely <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſons</hi> that are old diſciples, experienced in the myſteries of the Goſpel, and young <hi>Timothies</hi> that are train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the knowledge of the Scriptures; but there are alſo <hi>new borne babes 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. who are partakers of a ſpirtuall life, and yet are not able to apprehend that they have eternall life given unto them. There are in the fold of Chriſt, not onely <hi>ſheep</hi> which he leades forth into green paſtures, but there are alſo <hi>lambs</hi> which he gathers with his arme, and carries in his boſom, a place both of ſafety, and of warmth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11. Now if the eſſence of faith did lie in <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and that none did believe but they that did know they do believe, this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and difference between Chriſtians would be of little, or no uſe. If all that are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do exerciſe the reflex acts of faith, as well as the direct, in what ſhould the <hi>babe</hi> in Chriſt differ from the <hi>grown man?</hi> Where in ſhould the <hi>bruiſed reed</hi> be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115728:101"/> from the <hi>eſtabliſhed Cedar?</hi> How ſhould the <hi>thirſtie and wearied ſoule</hi> that dares not deny Chriſt to be his, and yet cannot ſay that certainly he is his, be comforted? How ſhould the <hi>ſinking</hi> and well nigh <hi>deſpairing</hi> Chriſtian that cries out he hath no ſaving faith, becauſe no <hi>Aſsurance,</hi> have doubts and objections comfortably anſwered? What uſe would there be of ſignes and markes which the Scripture gives as a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> into the hands of weak ones, to ſupport and ſtay them up, if faith do ſtand in a full perſwaſion of Gods love to a mans ſelf in particular? St. <hi>Johns</hi> whole epiſtle which was written for this end that believers might know that they had eternall life, 1. <hi>John.</hi> 5. 13. would be to no purpoſe. if faith it ſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the knowledg of their having it.</p>
                  <p>A fourth demonſtration is taken from the <hi>object</hi> of ſaving and juſtifying faith, which is the <hi>perſon of Chriſt,</hi> and not any <hi>Maxim</hi> or <hi>Propoſition</hi> which is the object of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That on which the chief act of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith is exerciſed, that is the primarie object of faith. But the maine act of faith is to unite Chriſt and a believer together, for by being one with him we come to be juſtified
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115728:101"/> by him and not otherwiſe. Now that which makes this <hi>Union</hi> on the believers part, is the adherence and cleaving of the ſoule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, as the greateſt and chiefeſt good. As the luſtfull and evil eye by looking upon a woman doth make ſuch a Union with her in his heart and affections, as that thereby he is judged by our Saviour to be guilty of Adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. So the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, and the true deſire of enjoying him, is ſuch a Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glance, as makes a tye and Union between Chriſt and the ſoule, that thus lookes towards him for life and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, <hi>If faith be not Aſſurance, and a perſwaſion in particular that Chriſt is mine; Wherein lyes the application of faith which Divines do ſo much urgeand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for againſt the Papiſts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Obiection. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Popiſh faith which ſtands in a <hi>bare generall aſſent</hi> unto the promiſes, and the truths which are revealed in the Goſpel, is wholly inſufficient to ſalvation, and that there is neceſſarily required to an effectuall and ſaving faith a ſpeciall and particular application, as hath been formerly ſhewed But there is a twofold <hi>Application;</hi> the one
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115728:102"/> is <hi>Axiomaticall,</hi> and the other is <hi>Reall.</hi> The <hi>Axiomaticall</hi> application is that which Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance makes, whereby a believer is enabled to ſay, Chriſt is mine. The <hi>Reall</hi> applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion faith makes, in which though a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot ſay that Chriſt is his; yet he doth by an act of recumbency <hi>caſt himſelfe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt for ſalvation, and reſolves neither to ſeek it, nor expect it any other way. Thus the Prodigal, <hi>Luke.</hi> 15. 18. did caſt himſelf upon his father when he could not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would owne him as his ſonne, or make him ſo much as an hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, it may be objected, <hi>If faith be not Aſsurance, wherein doth lye the certainty of faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that there is a double cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: The one is a certainty of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Thomas</hi> had, who ſeeing believed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 29. And ſuch a certainty Aſſurance hath, which is rather a kind of ſenſe then faith. The other is a certaintie of event, and this faith hath, though it want the former. He that believes ſhall as certainly not periſh as he who is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red though he doth not know it after that manner as the other doth. Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that <hi>he who cometh to him, he will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115728:102"/> in nowiſe caſt out, John</hi> 6. 37. The words include more then they expreſſe. He will be ſo farre from caſting out any that come to him, as that he will embrace them in the armes of his deareſt love, and manifeſt the moſt tender compaſſions of his heart towards them.</p>
                  <p>But the end of all that hath been ſpoken in anſwer to this Querie, is not that any ſhould reſt in their having of faith without aſſurance, or leſſen their giving of all diligence to make their calling and election ſure. Though a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor may be pardoned and he not know of it, yet he cannot be ſo comfortable, as he that carries his pardon ſealed in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. He whom God loves, though he know it not, is happy; but he that knowes it, knowes himſelfe to be happy.</p>
                  <p>And therefore believers though they are not to faint under the want of Aſſurance, or to conclude againſt themſelves, that they have no faith becauſe they have no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yet they ought in prayer and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances to ſeek not onely the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eternall life but the knowledge of their having it in Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> In which the ſecond Query is reſolved.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Query is, What uſe a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may make of the promiſes of mercy and pardon, after relapſes and falling into groſſe ſins, which waſte the conſcience; and whether he may lay an immediate claime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his right and intereſt in them, without his being firſt humbled, and afflicted for his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that though it be not with a believer under the Goſpel; as it was with the <hi>Nazarite</hi> under the Law; who if he were defiled in the time of his conſecration, loſt all the former dayes of his ſeparation, and was to begin it wholly anew. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 12. though he do not by his preſent defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment loſe the vertue of his former clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and purifying of himſelfe, ſo as to extinguiſh his intereſt in the promiſes; yet his right may juſtly be ſuſpended, ſo as that he cannot actually enjoy the benefit
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115728:103"/> and priviledge of them, untill he firſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe, and lay to heart the greatneſſe of his defection and Apoſtaſie from God. But that I may give more diſtinct and cleare ſatisfaction to this Queſtion, I ſhall ſpeak to theſe two heads. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew how farre a believer may and ought to charge the guilt of atrocious ſinnes that he falls into up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe. Secondly, I ſhall ſhew how farre he may not go, or conclude any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt himſelfe: there being errours oftentimes committed in the exceſſe, as well as in the defect.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115728:104"/> thereon, and wept.</hi> But <hi>Teophilact,</hi> and others with him interpret it, <hi>Obvelavit ſe,</hi> he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his head, and wept. Alluding to the generall cuſtome in the Eaſterne Countreys, where the condemned malefactors had their faces covered. And by this ceremony <hi>Peter</hi> judged his ſinne to have deſerved no leſſe then death, and as a ſonne of death he wailed himſelfe: <hi>He wept bitterly,</hi> Luk. 22. 62.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a believer may ſo farre charge the guilt of groſſe ſinnes, and defections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe, as to acknowledge <hi>his utter unworthineſſe to stand in any relation of love unto God,</hi> and that he might be ſo farre from owning him as a ſonne, as that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to look upon him in the number of his ſervants. Thus the <hi>Prodigal</hi> (whom Divines not improbably conceive to be the embleme of <hi>a regenerate man falling</hi> into ſcandalous ſinnes) in his returne to his father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 19. acknowledgeth himſelfe to be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called his ſonne. Though he doth not deny the relation of a ſonne; yet he judgeth himſelfe moſt unworthy of the title of a ſonne, and thinkes it an happineſſe if he may but be in his houſe as an hireling. And ſurely every child of God, who hath through looſe and riotous living waſted both his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115728:105"/> grace and his comforts, and brought ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities upon himſelfe by ſtraying from his fathers houſe, ought in thoſe reſolutions and purpoſes of heart, which he hath of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning unto God againe, to be deeply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive how unworthy he is of any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception from him, how unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving he is to lodge in his houſe as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, much more to lie in his boſome as a ſonne, that thereby he may the better <hi>prize</hi> the mercy of reſtored love; and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may the more dread the ſad effects of a <hi>voluntary</hi> departure from God, and be more <hi>watchfull</hi> in preſerving his communion with him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a believer falling into ſcandalous and vile pollutions, ought ſo farre to judge himſelfe, and to charge the guilt of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul; <hi>as not to lay hold immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſes of forgiveneſſe, untill he first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his repentance, and be throughly aſhamed of the evil of his doings.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for <hi>Miriam</hi> whom God had ſmitten with aleproſie; <hi>If her father</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not have been aſhamed ſeven dayes?</hi> Numb. 12. 44. That is, if her earthly father provoked to anger, had expreſſed his diſpleaſure by ſpitting upon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115728:105"/> her, ſhould ſhe not for a ſeaſon have been ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and penſive? How much more then when her heavenly Father is diſpleaſed by her ſinne, ſhould ſhe for a time be aſhamed, and ſhut out from the priviledges and ſociety of the Congregation? To be guilty of great ſinnes, and at the ſame time without remorſe, and grief of heart to lay hold on the promiſes of mercy; is not the acting of faith, but of preſumption; becauſe faith alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds according to Gods method in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of peace, and comfort. Now the way by which God ſpeakes peace, and makes good the promiſes of forgiveneſſe, is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And therefore till that be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the comfort of pardon is ſuſpended. Firſt, <hi>God heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelfe, Jer.</hi> 31. 18. And then <hi>he remembred him:</hi> then he manifeſts the bowels of a tender Father, and ſaith, <hi>I will ſurely have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,</hi> verſ. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a believer falling into groſſe and peace-deſtroying ſinnes, is ſo farre to charge the guilt of them upon his ſoul; as to acknowledge, <hi>That all thoſe temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and chaſtiſements, which God as a Father provoked to anger, doth lay upon him, are by his ſinnes justly deſerved, and by God righteouſly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115728:106"/> inflicted.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat God doth make his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to feel the ſmart of his diſpleaſure in heavy and ſore afflictions, occaſioned by their iniquities, is a truth which the Scripture holds forth with ſo much evidence, that he that runnes may reade it: <hi>They rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them,</hi> Iſa. 63. 10. So again, <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe was I wroth, and ſmote him: I hid me, and was wroth,</hi> Iſa. 57. 17. What pregnant inſtances alſo were old <hi>Eli,</hi> upon whoſe perſon and poſterity God brings a moſt ſevere, and dreadfull judgement? I <hi>Sam. 2. 31, 32, 33. David,</hi> who complaines that his ſinnes are a burthen too heavy for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 4. that his wounds ſtink, and are corrupted becauſe of his fooliſhneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that he is feeble and ſore broken, <hi>v. 8. Jonah,</hi> who cries out of the belly of the whale, as out of the belly of hell, that he is forſaken and caſt out of Gods ſight, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 2, 3. How eaſie were it by an addition of examples in this kinde to make the number to ſwell into a Catalogue? But a taſte is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Now what their carriage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards God is in this condition, ſee it in their expreſſions. Old <hi>Eli</hi> when he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115728:106"/> heard of the judgement of God denounced againſt him, ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18. <hi>David</hi> under all his preſſures acknowledgeth, that <hi>in faithfulneſſe he had afflicted him,</hi> Pſal. 119. 75. So <hi>Jonah</hi> who had fled from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, in the prayer that he poureth out before him in his extremity, confeſſeth the ſinne, and vanity of all other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies ſave on God alone: <hi>They that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercies,</hi> Jonah 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, <hi>How can it ſtand with the justice of God to puniſh ſinne in his children, with any ſuch kinde of affliction; Christ having made an abſolute, and plenary ſatisfaction for them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the anſwer is eaſie; that theſe temporal puniſhments, though they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure mixed with them, yet they do not ſlow from the vindictive juſtice of God, as an <hi>irreconciled enemy;</hi> but are the corrections of a <hi>provoked Father,</hi> and do wholly differ in the end from the vindictive which are not medicinal, but deſtructive. The <hi>Judge</hi> who ſentenceth the hand of a malefactor to be cut off, hath not the ſame end with the <hi>Phyſician</hi> that cuts of an hand when it is incurably
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115728:107"/> feſtred; the <hi>one</hi> commands it as a <hi>ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> due to juſtice; the other enjoynes it, as <hi>a meanes</hi> to preſerve the ſafety of the other parts: So when God afflicts the wicked and believers with the ſame temporal evils; though the ſmart and paine may be in both alike; yet he doth it not with the ſame mind, nor to the ſame end; the one he puniſheth in order to the ſatisfaction of his juſtice, the other as a Father he corrects in order to their amendment; to the one therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a puniſhment, and to the other truly a medicine.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond head that I am to ſpeake unto, is, to ſhew how farre believers are not to charge the guilt of their great and moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes upon themſelves: And this alſo take in the foure following particulars,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, believers are not to charge the guilt of ſuch ſinnes upon themſelves, as from thence to conclude, <hi>that there is an abſolute
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115728:107"/> fall from the ſtate of juſtification, and the grace of Adoption;</hi> ſo as that now they are no longer ſonnes, nor have any right to the heavenly inheritance. The love of God in Chriſt is an endleſſe, and unchangeable love, <hi>John</hi> 13. 1. and hath its perpetuity founded not upon any thing in us, but upon the firme rock of his Will, and Counſel. <hi>His Covenant is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, ordered in all things, and ſure:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we <hi>be not ſo with God,</hi> 1 Sam. 23. 5. True it is that the fall, and lapſes of a juſtified perſon, do ſo farre make a breach upon his ſtate of juſtification, and adoption; as that the comforts and priviledges of it are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by withheld and ſuſpended; but his right thereunto is not made null, or extinguiſhed. He is under the power of an <hi>interdiction;</hi> but not under the power of an <hi>ejection.</hi> He may not like <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſee the Kings face, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24. but he is not an <hi>exile.</hi> And in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he doth abide, untill he renew his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and thereby recover a fitneſſe and aptitude to enjoy what before he had a right unto; being like a cleanſed leper who hath the liberty of returning unto his houſe, from which his defilement had ſeparated him, and ſhut him out. Now if any think the effects, and conſequences of this ſpiritual ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115728:108"/> do import little, and that they are not antidotes ſtrong enough to check the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the fleſh which is in believers, and to keep them from playing the wantons with the grace of God: To ſuch, all that I ſhall ſay, is, that to me they ſeem to be as blinde men, that underſtaud little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the wide difference between the light of the Sunne, and the darkneſſe of the night: and to have little experience in themſelves, how ſad the condition of that ſoul is, from whom God hides his face, or turnes his ſmiles into frownes: and how happy he is in the overflowings of all joy, peace, and comfort, who hath the ſhine of Gods face to be the health of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, believers are not to charge the guilt of criminall ſinnes into which they fall upon themſelves, <hi>ſo as thereby to apprehend or conclude that the pardon of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes is made void, and of none effect.</hi> The forgiveneſſe of ſinnes paſt may ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate and accent the iniquities that are afterwards committed, being done againſt the riches of mercy received; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of new ſinnes doth not revoke the pardon that was before given, or make the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115728:108"/> guilt of ſuch ſinnes to returne again in their full ſtrength and power; no more then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent debts do make bonds formerly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled and vacated to ſtand in force. For God when he pardons, doth not inſert any conditional clauſes, that carry a reſpect to our future converſation, and make the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of his pardon to depend upon our well or ill doing. His gifts and graces are the fruits of his immutable counſel and will, and therefore without all repentance It may not be denied, but that this truth hath diverſe Adverſaries: the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are vehement in their oppoſition of it; as alſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Arminians.</hi> And yet I ſay they who have skill and leaſure to conſult the Schoolmen who much agitate this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>An peccata redeant? Whether ſinnes pardoned do ever returne, and live again in their guilt, ſo as to accuſe and to condemne?</hi> Will finde there are more who are for the Negative then for the Affirmative. But it is not my purpoſe to enter into the liſts, and to take up the waſters in this Controverſie: It is enough that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-expreſſions concerning Gods pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne, do clearly hold forth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of them to be full and abſolute: <hi>I
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115728:109"/> have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and as a cloud thy ſinnes, Iſay.</hi> 44. 22. The cloud that is ſcattered or diſſolved by the ſunne, though others may ſucceed it, never returnes to make a ſecond appearance; but is wholly extinguiſhed, and therefore mans going downe into the grave, who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes unto the land of the living again, is compared unto it, <hi>Job.</hi> 7. 9. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>The ſinnes of Judah ſhall not be found, for I will pardon them ſaith the Lord.</hi> So againe, <hi>Micah.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Thou wilt cast all their ſins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depths of the ſea.</hi> Things that are caſt into the bottome of the ſea, never come to ſight again; but are more ſurely buried then things that are hid in the grave and in the bowels of the earth, which may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be digged out again. What more ſignificant words can be uſed to declare the abſoluteneſſe of Gods pardoning <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſin then theſe of the Prophets?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, beleivers falling into groſſe and conſcience waſting ſinnes, are not to charge the guilt of them upon themſelves, ſo as to conclude thereby, <hi>that they have utterly lost all ſanctifying and inherent grace.</hi> Such ſins may make a believer to be as a man in a woone who is without all motion; but not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115728:109"/> as a carcaſe which is without all life. They may be in his heart, as ſpiders in an hive, which ſpoile the honey, but do not kill the bees; they blaſt and wither the precious fruites of grace and profeſſion, but they do not wholly deſtroy the root, and principle from whence they flow. Still the ſeed of God abideth in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. The Apoſtaſie of <hi>Peter</hi> in denying out Saviour was great: It was a complicated deniall; there was in it <hi>Negatio notitiae,</hi> a deniall of ſo much as knowing him: and <hi>Negatio conſortii,</hi> a deniall of all communion, and converſe with him. And yet in this reiterated defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the faith of <hi>Peter</hi> did not expire and give up the ghoſt. For Chriſt prayed that his faith might not faile, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 32. Now the ground of this indeficiency in grace is not from its own ſtrength, as it is a quality in us; but from the covenant and promiſe of God, who hath ſaid, that he will put his feare into our hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>Qui custodit nos per fidem, costodit in nobis ipſam fidem:</hi> He that keeps us by faith, doth keep faith it ſelf in us.</p>
                  <p>This particular is very neceſſary for ſuch Chriſtians to think upon, who after a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115728:110"/> into ſome foule ſinne: do not onely mourne over their folly, as they juſtly ought; but are apt alſo to complaine that heretofore indeed they had ſome good in them; a little faith they could by ſome effects diſcerne in themſelves, a ſpark of love to God was once kindled in their breaſts. But now alas, all is utterly extinct. and loſt! Now they are in no better condition <hi>then in the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bonds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity:</hi> a rude and deformed <hi>chaos</hi> of ſinne and folly, without any principle of grace or appearance of beauty. And in thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they do not onely <hi>heighten</hi> their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent darkneſſe and trouble, but alſo are <hi>injurious</hi> unto the promiſe and faithfulneſſe of God, who hath fixed grace in the heart of a believer more firmely then the ſoul is feated in the body, which is ſubject to death and diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, believers are not ſo to charge the guilt of their great ſinnes upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as from thence to infer any ſuch ſad concluſions as theſe: <hi>That they never ſhall enjoy any day or houre of comfort again; but walk in continuall darkneſse,</hi> or that they ſhall never be uſed any more as inſtruments of ſervice, or be a veſſel unto honour meet
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115728:110"/> for the maſters uſe; but be as the broken ſhards, that are not fit <hi>to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the pit, Iſay.</hi> 30. 14. That they who defile themſelves with voluntary and groſſe ſinnes, if we look unto the juſt merit of them, deſerve to be ſo dealt with, it cannot be denied. But that God doth retaliate the ſinnes of his children with ſuch dealings though they be deeply humbled for their Apoſtaſie, and with ſtrong cries do begge both pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance from himſelf, is contrary not onely to the promiſes of mercy, which he hath made to penitent ſinners, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to many pregnant inſtances of ſuch whom he hath both comforted with his love, and highly honoured with his ſervice. With what expreſſions and demonſtrations of affection is the dejected <hi>Prodigal</hi> received by his father? who <hi>peccanti filio dat oſcula, non flagella,</hi> gives to his ſtraying ſonne kiſſes, and not blowes, ſaith <hi>Chryſologus.</hi> No food is too good to ſatisfy his hunger, no rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too coſtly to cloath him with, no ornament too precious to adorne him. The fatted calfe, the beſt robe, the ring of gold are the ſure pledges of his fathers love, <hi>Luke.</hi> 15. What a choice veſſel of honour
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115728:111"/> and ſervice was <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall, who was honoured with the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and had his labours crowned with the converſion of many thouſand ſoules? Let not therefore ſuch who have fallen by their iniquities, but yet return again by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance, ſay, that all their dayes ſhall end in darkneſſe, that their names ſhall ever be unſavoury, that themſelves ſhall alwayes be as barren and dry trees; but let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that comfortable promiſe that God made to repenting Iſrael, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 19, 20. who tells them, that <hi>he will get them praiſe and fame in every land, where they have been put to ſhame.</hi>

               <p>THe third Query which I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and endeavour to ſatisfie, is,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115728:111"/> 
                  <hi>What uſe a believer may make of all thoſe glorious and rich promiſes which he can never expect to ſee the performance of;</hi> ſuch as are the beauty and proſperity of the <hi>Church</hi> in peace and holineſſe, when all pricking briers, and grieving thornes ſhall be removed out of the midſt of it: The calling and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The downefall and ruine of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> All which ſeeme to be as bleſſings reſerved for future ages, and not to be hoped for in the preſent times?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that true it is, that the promiſes of God are as <hi>bonds of a different date,</hi> and do ſucceſſively take place in ſeveral ages and generations of the Church: being ſo purpoſely ordered by the infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that though he be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompliſhing ſome one or other of his bleſſed promiſes unto his people; there might yet be a moſt plentifull reſerve of new mercies unto the laſt ages of the world; that ſo it might appeare that former ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations have not exhauſted or diminiſhed the treaſure of his love and bounty to the prejudice of thoſe that ſhould ſucceed them, But yet ſuch promiſes which future times, and not the preſent ſhall ſee to be fulfilled, are of much uſe unto preſent believers, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115728:112"/> by the due application of them may yield much ſatisfaction and comfort unto thoſe who like the Patriarchs can ſee them afarre off, and being perſwaded of the truth of them, do joyfully imbrace them, as <hi>Mariners</hi> do the deſired port at a diſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. It was a great comfort and contentment unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that though God would not let him enter into the land of promiſe, yet before his death, he would from the top of <hi>Piſgah</hi> give him a full proſpect of its glory and beauty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 1. And ſo to a believer it muſt needs be a matter of much joy and delight, that though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live to partake of the future mercies that God hath reſerved for his Church; yet he may by the eye of faith have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct view of them in the promiſes, as in a lively map, and may behold the glory of that portion of bleſſing and goodneſſe which God will beſtow upon his people in the ages that are to come. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly there may be a foure fold uſe made by a believer of all ſuch promiſes, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment do ſeeme to be at a remote diſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance and period of times.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they are uſefull to ſupport and beare up believers under preſent troubles
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115728:112"/> and ſore afflictions, that the Church may be exerciſed with, that it ſhall not be ruined and undone by them. <hi>Navicula est quae turbari potest, ſed mergi non potest:</hi> The Church is as a ſhip, (ſaith <hi>Austine</hi>) which may be toſſed with tempeſts, but cannot be ſunk and ſhipwrackt by them. It being the onely heir of all the promiſes that God hath made, it muſt live to enjoy them; elſe they muſt become void and of no effect; or be as <hi>Bona adeſpota,</hi> Goods that have no perſon or Lord to lay claime unto them. And if we conſult the Scriptures, we ſhall finde, that in the times which were moſt dark and over-caſt, God did moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe ſuch promiſes to confirme to his people their deliverance out of preſent ſtraits, that were not to take place till many ages after, that from thence they might conclude their condition not to be hopeleſſe and deſperate in regard of future bleſſings which God would performe to their ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Thus when <hi>Jacob</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where his ſeed were oppreſſed with a long and heavie bondage, he propheſieth that the <hi>ſcepter ſhould not depart from Judah, till Shiloh came, Gen.</hi> 49. 10. So when <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> joyned
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115728:113"/> in a confederacy againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and that the hearts of the people through feare were as the trees of the wood, when moved with the winde, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7. 3. the Lord to aſſure his people that they ſhould be delivered, and that their attempts againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould not come to paſs; gives no other ſigne but this: <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive, and beare a ſon, and ye ſhall call his name Immanuel, verſ.</hi> 14. It was the land in which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world was to be borne, and they the tribe from which he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend; And therefore they might be fully confident, that for that very promiſe ſake, ruine and exti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So again in <hi>Iſraels</hi> long captivity of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares, though multitudes of them in that long tract of time could expect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty then to be free among the dead; yet the Lord in the beginning of it doth by the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which was to be read unto them, promiſe deliverance out of it, and comforts them with the aſſurance of their freedom, and their enemies ruine, of both which he makes the caſting of the Prophets book into the midſt of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to be a ſigne unto them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 63, 64. And why then may not we in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115728:113"/> and divided times, both in regard of opinion and practice, yet hope and believe, that thoſe bleſſed promiſes of Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with which God hath promiſed to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Church, ſhall at length be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and from thence gather ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comfort, as not to deeme our breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es incurable, and paſt all healing? True it is, that Chriſtians are like bees gone forth into ſo many ſwarmes, as that to reaſon it ſeemes beyond poſſibility, that ever they ſhould by the ſound of the Word (as by a golden bell) be brought under one hive. But yet that one promiſe of Gods <hi>giving his people one heart, and one way, that they may feare him for ever for the good of them and their children after them, Jer.</hi> 32. 39. is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſupport thoſe that are peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers that their labour ſhall not be in vain, and to comfort thoſe that mourne for the ſad rents that are made, that there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch promiſes are uſeful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as a firme rock to bottome their prayers upon, which they make on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Church. To pray that Chriſts Kingdome may come, and that it may ſpread it ſelf unto the utmoſt ends of the earth,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115728:114"/> is the duty of every Chriſtian: But the ground of their making ſuch prayers, and of their confidence in obtaining them, doth wholly ariſe from the promiſes that God hath made. He it is who hath promiſed, that <hi>Christ ſhall reigne, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. He it is who hath ſaid, that <hi>Zion ſhall ſuck the milk of the Gentiles, and ſhall ſuck the breaſts of Kings, Iſa.</hi> 60. 16. That <hi>her Horne ſhall be iron, and her hoofs braſſe, to break in peeces many people, Micha</hi> 4. 13. And thereby are they encouraged to ſeek his face, and to put him in minde of his gracious promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people. True it is, that the times and ſeaſons when theſe things ſhall be, are unknown unto them, neither are they to be curious and anxious about them: God having put them in his own power, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. But yet knowing that he who hath promiſed, is faithful, they do with delight plead them in their prayers, and with faith embrace them in their armes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuch promiſes are uſefull to try the ſincerity of a believers affection and love to Gods glory, and to the welfare of the Church. Promiſes wherein mens preſent intereſts a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e concerned, ſelf-love may make
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115728:114"/> them to put a value upon them, and quicken an ardency both in their prayers and deſires to begge the performance of them, as judging themſelves to be moſt happy in the enjoyment of thoſe bleſſings which are held forth in them. And ſurely from this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle are many ſtirred up to plead with much earneſtneſſe the promiſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, when they are under ſome immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger; the promiſes of proviſion, when under ſome pinching want; the promiſes of comfort, when under ſome ſore affliction. But when a Chriſtian can rejoyce in ſuch promiſes, which ſpeak the future happineſſe of the Church when he is dead and gone: When it is ſweet to him to thinke, that Chriſts throne ſhall hereafter be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, his Name more known, his Spirit more plentifully poured forth, that the Church ſhall triumph over its enemies, and be an habitation of peace, of love: It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a noble frame of heart, and of a ſpirit that is truly affected with the love of Gods glory. When a man can ruminate upon ſuch promiſes with delight, and can in prayer manifeſt that it is the deſire of his ſoul, that theſe things wherein God will be ſo highly honoured, may be effected; it
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115728:115"/> is a comfortable evidence, that the white at which he levells, and the end which he propounds to himſelf, do not terminate in his private intereſt, but in the exaltation of the Name of God, which by faith he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhall be magnified throughout all ages of the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuch promiſes are uſefull to comfort believers in regard of their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is oft-times a perplexing thought to tender parents, eſpecially in difficult times, to think what will become of their children if they ſhould be taken from them, and their ſeed be deprived of the benefit of that care and counſel, which while they live they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly partake of. And this very thing doth beget as much anxiety in their hearts, as the departure of Chriſt did in his diſciples it being an evil, that though foreſeen, they ſcarce know how ſatisfactorily to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Now beſides thoſe generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations drawne from thoſe compaſſions and bowels that are in God, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in providing for the righteous and their ſeed, according to his promiſe: All which may help to allay ſuch diſtruſtful thoughts and cares. There may alſo not a little ſupport and comfort be taken from the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115728:115"/> exerciſing of faith on ſuch eminent promiſes, as declare the riches of Gods goodneſſe to the ages and times that are to come: All which God will according to their appointed ſeaſons fulfill, untill that grand and laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of gathering all his elect unto himſelf in glory be accompliſhed; So that believers may comfortably hope, that what promiſes themſelves do fall ſhort of, their poſterity ſhall in one kind or other be partakers of. And though through the dark diſpenſations of preſent providences, the Church may ſeem to be in the midſt of an howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, rather then near the borders of a <hi>Canaan:</hi> yet ſurely the Land of reſt is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, though it may to us be out of ſight.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Wherein the fourth Query is reſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether believers alwayes enjoy the comfort of aſſurance in death?</head>
               <p>THe fourth Query is, Whether belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who are moſt diligent in the daily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115728:116"/> application of the promiſes, and in the uſe of all means to make their calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure, do alwayes enjoy the comfort of aſſurance in death Or have, as the Apoſtle expreſſed it, <hi>an entrance abundantly miniſtred unto them into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>The anſwer that I ſhall give unto this Queſtion, will conſiſt of diverſe branches, which I ſhall lay downe in four Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that a believer as he meets with many brunts and conflicts in his life, ſo he may and often doth meet with worſe at his death. Chriſt his agonie and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſharpeſt towards the cloſe and end of his life. And then, though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not of God; yet in a moſt vehement expoſtulation he complains to God, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me? Mat.</hi> 27. 46. Lamb-like and ſilent deaths are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the portion of Gods deareſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The wicked may have no paines and bands in their death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 4. when the beſt of Saints may be environed with terrors. The one may be as a man in a ſleep, who may have pleaſant and golden dreames;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115728:116"/> and the other as a man awake that is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſquieted with grievous and ſore paroxiſmes. Thus good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in that ſickneſſe, in which he was by the Prophet ſummoned to prepare for death, through the ſad apprehenſions of Gods diſpleaſure, poured forth his ſoule in bitter complaints, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 38. he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>I reckoned till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that. as a lion ſo will he break all my bones,</hi> And. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Like a Crane or ſwallow, ſo did I chatter.</hi> Grief and paine had both ſo filled and waſted him, as that he could one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make an indiſtinct and confuſed noiſe; as thoſe birds do when they are deprived of their young ones. And therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not to be diſcouraged as if ſome new thing had befallen them, if in the cloſe and ſhutting up of their lives, inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable gales, and breathings of the Spirit, they finde (contrary to their expectation) Satan to aſſault them, or God to withdraw himſelf from them who for a <hi>moment</hi> hides his face, but with <hi>everlaſting</hi> kindneſſe will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them <hi>Iſay.</hi> 54. 8.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is, that our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to clear up our intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the uſing of all meanes to make our calling and election ſure, is the <hi>ordinary
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115728:117"/> and regular way to obtaine comfort,</hi> and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in death. To expect to dye comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and not to live holily, is as vaine, as for a man to look for ſtars on earth, and trees in heaven. To waſte the <hi>oile of grace,</hi> and yet to think to be anointed with the <hi>oile of gladneſſe,</hi> is the fruit of preſumption, and not of faith. When ſervants idle out the light that their Maſters give them to work by, they may well conclude that they muſt go to bed in the dark. And ſo when Chriſtians do neglect in the day of their life to work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling, it is no wonder if in the night of death they want the light of comfort, and have a dark <hi>exit</hi> out of the world.</p>
               <p>The third Propoſition is, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the promiſes, and the diligent uſe of all meanes to make our calling and election ſure, is not onely the ordinary and regular way, <hi>but doth uſually procure comfort in death,</hi> unleſſe it be in foure particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when <hi>ſickneſſes</hi> and diſtempers are <hi>violent,</hi> ſo as to interrupt and ſuſpend the uſe of <hi>reaſon;</hi> it muſt needs be that thereby alſo the comforts of <hi>grace</hi> be ſo farre eclipſed, as to be like <hi>ſtarres</hi> in a cloudy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115728:117"/> night, which though they be not <hi>blotted</hi> out of their orbe, yet do not ſhine: Who can expect that an untuned inſtrument ſhould ever make a melodious harmony? no more can any man rationally conceive, that when the frame of nature is out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the organs of the body wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to the acts of reaſon; that then the comforts of the Spirit ſhould appeare in their beauty and luſtre? Now that God oft-times puts a period unto the lives of his deareſt children by ſuch diſeaſes cannot be denied: For <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us; that <hi>All things come alike unto all; there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when <hi>temptations</hi> and aſſaults from Satan are like <hi>vehement windes</hi> which ſhake the tree, though they do not overturn it. A man who hath a fair eſtate of lands, may by vexatious ſuites be ſo put to try his title, as that he may take little pleaſure in the revenues and profits iſſuing from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo a believer in his combating and wreſtling with temptations may ſo far be diſquieted, as that though he queſtion not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115728:118"/> his condition, he may yet enjoy leſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and preſent delight in his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and aſſurance then formerly he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> after his rapture into the third heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. was buffeted by a meſſenger of Satan, whereby he was not onely kept from being exalted above meaſure; but alſo interrupted in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe choice comforts and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, which ſuch revelations might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto him: as may appear by his frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and importunity in prayer to God, to be delivered from this ſad conflict, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when Chriſtians have <hi>intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that wonted care and circumſpection</hi> to preſerve their peace and communion with God, which formerly they uſed. When they have been more forgetful of God, and leſſe delighted with his preſence then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were. When they have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world to ſteal away their thoughts, and affections from heaven, and through a diſtempered appetite reliſh more their daily bread, then the ſpiritual Manna. When they grow regardleſſe of Chriſts voice, and open not their hearts to him, who ſeeks and entreates an admittance; then it is no wonder if their <hi>Sun ſet in a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115728:118"/> cloud,</hi> and that the horrour of a ſad dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe do take hold upon them: that then like the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that their <hi>Beloved hath withdrawn himſelf and is gone: that they ſeek him, but cannot finde him; that they call him by all his bleſſed and gracious names, and yet he anſwereth not,</hi> Cant. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When their <hi>graces</hi> and alſo their <hi>comforts have been already fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, both to themſelves and others, in the time of their life;</hi> God may in the approaches of death, for ſundry reaſons beſt known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, withdraw his comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and not fill their ſouls with thoſe exultations of joy and peace which others might expect to be mingled with their laſt agonies, and expirations in death: ſo as that they ſhould be carried up to heaven in the light of a glorious <hi>Plerophory;</hi> like to the. Angel which aſcended in the flame of <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ahs</hi> ſacrifice, <hi>Judges</hi> 13. 20. God may do it,</p>
               <p>Firſt, to trie and manifeſt the <hi>ſtrength of their faith,</hi> that though their feelings are not ſtrong, yet their faith is not weak; that though they ſee not the crown of bliſſe and immortality hovering as it were over
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115728:119"/> them, and ready to fall upon their heads, they yet beleeve that it is laid up for them, and that they ſhall ere long ſee it, and enjoy it together. Such faith highly glorifies God, and in ſome reſpects gives more honour unto him then Aſſurance, which hath a kinde of ſenſe joyned with it. That, like <hi>Thomas</hi> ſees and beleeves; but this ſees not, and yet beleeves that what God hath promiſed he will perform.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God may do it, that <hi>others may learn that comforts and manifestations of love in death are not ſo neceſſary as grace,</hi> and therefore not to be diſmaied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in their thoughts concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they finde not ſuch overflowings of joy and prelibations of heaven it ſelf as ſome: others have had in the time of death. All believers though they are heires of the ſame Kingdome, yet have not the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant entrance miniſtred unto them. To ſome the paſſage is like the going upon a clear and chryſtal ſtream, which hath flowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and aromatical bancks on each ſide of it: to others it is like a calme and quiet ſea on which as the fluctuations and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are few or none; ſo the gales that carry them to the Port are not ſtrong and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115728:119"/> quick. As their temptations are not great; ſo neither are their comforts glorious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God may do it <hi>in judgement to others;</hi> that ſuch who have known and ſeen the light of holineſſe ſhining in their lives, and yet have not in the leaſt been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by it; ſhould not get the leaſt good by their deaths. As they have not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their graces; ſo neither will he let them be edified by their comforts. Carnal men are oft-times more ready to obſerve the dying of holy perſons, then their lives; becauſe that then they conceive, it may be ſeen what reality there is in that profeſſion which they have made of having communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, &amp; of enjoying his peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in a differing manner from the world. Now they think it will appear whether their faith be any thing beyond a phancy; whether their joyes be ſuch as death will not caſt a dampe upon, as well as upon the delights and pleaſures of the world. And when their curioſity is unſatisfied in what they expected, then they ſpare not to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them as deceivers both of themſelves, and others. Little conſidering that the juſt ground of Gods cauſing ſuch bright ſtarres to ſet in a cloud, may be to hide from
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115728:120"/> them what might benefit them in their death, who have learned nothing from the holy example of their lives. The obſtinate Jewes oppoſed the Doctrine which Chriſt taught; and rejected the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which he offered unto them whilſt he was among them: And then at his death inſultingly ask for miracles that might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be the Son of God, whereby they might believe on him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 42. But God then made his death a ſtone of ſtumbling for them to fall at, who had made his life and converſe among them to be the object of ſcorne both to themſelves and others.</p>
               <p>The fourth Propoſition is, that <hi>the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and eſtimate which beleevers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make concerning mens ſpiritual eſtates and conditions ſhould chiefly be grounded upon their lives, rather then their deaths. There may many accidents fall out in their death, which as they do not prejudice a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſalvation; ſo neither ſhould they his Chriſtian reputation. He may through a feaver become phrenetical, through melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly he may be lumpiſh and heavy, through temptations he may be unſetled, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions he may ſpeak uncomfortable ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115728:120"/> &amp; be afflicted with deſpairing thoughts: His darkneſs may be without the leaſt glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of light: His agonies in death without ſenſe of comfort: And yet he may be a dear childe of God: Becauſe (as holy <hi>Greenham</hi> ſaith) we ſhall not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to that particular inſtant of death; but according to the general courſe of our life; not according to our deeds in that preſent, but according to the deſires of our hearts ever before. And therefore we are not to miſtruſt Gods mercy in death, be it never ſo uncomfortable, if ſo be it hath been before ſealed in our vocation and ſanctification. It is ſad indeed when the lives and dayes of thoſe do in ſuch a manner determine and expire, who have waſted their time and ſtrength in ſinful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies, and have been eaten up with the cares and thoughts of the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt minding of their eternal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till arreſted by the ſtroak of death, and ſummoned to appear at the tribunal of a provoked God. But elſe, though the cloſe of an holy life be moſt uncomfortable, and full of darkneſſe, it is no juſt ground to any, to change their apprehenſion and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the welfare of their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115728:121"/> eſtate, having before-hand ſeen and known ſuch unblameableneſſe of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch fruits of grace as might clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the uprightneſſe and ſincerity of their hearts towards God and men.</p>

After what manner are beleevers to act and exerciſe their faith upon them, or to hope for the performance of them; in regard that they oft-times who may beſt plead their title and intereſt in them do moſt of all want the fruition of ſuch mercies, <hi>They</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>of whom the world was not worthy, wandred about in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented,</hi> Heb. 11. 37, 38.</p>

               <p>Firſt, to ſhew why God under the Old Teſtament did make the tenour of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to run ſo univerſally of his giving unto them the bleſſings and enjoyments of this life; when as under the Goſpel ſuch kinde of promiſes are more ſparingly record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not ſo diſtinctly ſet down.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſhew the various advantage, and profit that believers may reape to their ſpirituall eſtate, by looking unto ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes with an eye of faith, and quietly wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good pleaſure of God for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 1.</hi> Why God hath made ſuch various promiſes of temporall mercies to his people under the Law.</head>
                  <p>For the firſt, <hi>viz. Gods making unto his people ſo many distinct and redoubled promiſes of temporall mercies,</hi> ſundry reaſons might be aſſigned, but I ſhall fix onely upon this: that ſuch away of bounty was moſt ſuitable to the winning of their obſervance unto ſuch adminiſtrations and formes of worſhip, as he then gave them in command, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their obedience unto. For <hi>untill the time of reformation came</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 10. That is, untill the time of the New Teſtament, when both the imperfection of the Law, and Prieſthood was to be done away by Chriſt, who as a more excellent Prieſt offered up a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſacrifice, all things were tranſacted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an earthly and externall manner. The <hi>Sanctuary</hi> was worldly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. The <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> impoſed on them were carnall, which ſtood in meates, and drinkes, and divers waſhings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. Now to this paedagogie of the Church, the promiſes of ſuch outward bleſſings were moſt agreeable.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115728:122"/> As the duties, and exerciſes of their religion were moſt converſant about the outward man; ſo likewiſe the promiſes that were the encouragements to move and incite them to an obſervancy of thoſe preſcribed rites, were ſuch as did chiefly hold forth the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and well-fare of their outward eſtate. Not that the goodneſſe of God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or his Covenant with them did extend onely to the care of their bodies, or that this was the utmoſt drift of thoſe many promiſes which he had made unto them. This had been (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeaks) to have made God to have had no more regard to his Church then ſhepherds have to their flock, or Herdſmen to their cattel, who look no further then to their thriving &amp; well liking in their paſtures. But as in their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other ceremonies of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they were trained up and inſtructed in the knowledge of ſpirituall duties towards God, in which their hearts and thoughts were to be imployed: So alſo by the temporall promiſes were grounds laid of carrying on their faith and hope for the obtaining of more glorious mercies then thoſe which at the preſent they enjoyed. Their <hi>Manna</hi> was a kinde of Sacramentall food, and the <hi>water</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:115728:123"/> from the rock a Sacramental drink, the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> a type of the true and heavenly reſt, which Chriſt hath purchaſed, which by him who was the ſubſtance of all ſhadowes they might expect. True it is, that both the precepts of their worſhip and the promiſes of their reward, were more darke and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, then the rule of our obedience, and the recompence of our ſervice under the Goſpel; but yet both did center &amp; terminate in one and the ſame end. The State of the Church under the Law was repreſented (ſaith <hi>Bright-man</hi>) by <hi>mare aereum,</hi> a ſea of braſſe, which is of a more thick and dark ſubſtance; but under the Goſpel by <hi>mare vitreum,</hi> a ſea of glaſſe, which is moſt clear and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular is, to ſhew the <hi>Severall benefits that redound to beleevers by looking unto temporall promiſes with an eye of faith.</hi> And here many might be inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edon; but I ſhall inſiſt onely on four.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:115728:123"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith in the promiſes of this life doth much help to the mortification of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires, and of diſtracting and anxious cares;</hi> Both which are the genuine fruits and off-ſpring of unbelief. Every man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious unto himſelfe both of his own wants, and of the fading condition of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and thereby he is ſtirred up to ſeek in a reſtleſſe manner a ſupply of preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and a ſolicitous proviſion for all future contingencies. Ask many a man why he toyles ſo unceſſantly to the breaking of his head with cares, and his body with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? And he will quickly tell you, that he hath none to truſt unto but himſelfe, that he knowes not what hard times and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may come: Sickneſſe may befall him, and waſte what he hath gotten: Age may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him, and render him unapt for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Charges may multiply in his family, and it is not the aire that will feed them. He had need therefore to do what he doth; if not, he and his might ſtarve. But now when a believer can look unto the promiſe, how ſoon are all theſe tempeſtuous thoughts and fears calmed? how ſweetly is the heart quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by caſting all its care upon God, <hi>who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. How quickly can be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115728:124"/> ſpie in the promiſes Gods obligation for cloathing to cover his nakedneſſe, for meat to ſatisfie his hunger, for Phyſick to cure his diſeaſes, for armour to ſafe-guard his perſon, for treaſure to provide for his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; poſterity? How fully can he reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the things which he hath, becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee, Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith exerciſed on the temporal promiſes, will much help to ſtrengthen our adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the promiſes of a better life,</hi> and cauſe us to truſt more perfectly in God for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſoules. Our Saviour tells his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 26. that if God fed the fowles, and cloathed the Lillies, he will much more provide for them which are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then they. And ſo may a believer argue with himſelfe, If God hath made ſo many rich promiſes of proviſion for the body, he will not be wanting to the happineſſe of the ſoul: if he be ſo carefull of the casket, he will not be unmindfull of the Jewel: if he give daily bread to the one, he will ſurely give Manna to the other: if he make our pilgrimage delightful, and make the paths of our feet to drop fatneſſe, he will make our reſt and habitation with himſelfe to be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115728:124"/> glorious. If the feet tread on Roſes here, and on the Moone and Starres hereafter, how orient and beautifull will be that crown of life that ſhall be ſet upon our heads? Such kinde of argumentations are very helpfull to a believer, who ownes all his outward comforts to ariſe from Gods faithfulneſſe in his promiſe, though in the meere and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked having of them no man can know love or hatred, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Faith exerciſed on the promiſes of this life, ſweetens the enjoyment of every bleſſing, be it little, or much.</hi> There are two ſources from whence all outward mercies flow, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, and the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God: The one is as the <hi>Nether-ſprings,</hi> from which every creature receives its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and continuance; <hi>He openeth his hand, and ſatisfieth the deſire of every living thing,</hi> Pſal. 145. 16. The other is as the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-ſprings,</hi> from which after a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the goodneſſe and bounty of God is conveyed unto believers. <hi>Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. Now the ſtreams that flow from this fountain are more pure, and free from that vexation and vanitie which the abundance that the wicked hath
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115728:125"/> is ſubject unto; becauſe they are ſanctified by Chriſt, in whom all the promiſes are Yea and Amen. When therefore a believer can look upon all his outward enjoyments as the fruits of Gods eſpeciall love, and can ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, Theſe are the bleſſings which God hath graciouſly given his ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 5. then they become in their uſe more delightfull, and in their taſte more ſweet. A ſmall portion of meat given by the hand of a great Perſonage, is more ſet by and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, then all the variety of his full table upon which his other gueſts do feed and carve themſelves; becauſe it carries with it a particular character and marke of favour to him on whom it is beſtowed: And ſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given by God as a Teſtimonie of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar love, and care towards believers is more deſirable and ſatisfactorie, then great revenues that flow onely from a common bounty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Faith exerciſed on the temporal promiſes, is a powerfull antidote to preſerve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from the uſe of unlawfull meanes,</hi> both in the ſeeking and in the obtaining of all earthly comforts. The inordinacy of the deſires puts men oft-times upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous precipices. <hi>He that maketh haſte
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115728:125"/> to he rich, ſhall not be innocent,</hi> Prov. 28. 20. So, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and a ſnare, and many hurtfull luſts,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9. Now faith, though it do not take off the edge of mens induſtry, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the purſuance of all lawfull and juſt means, or make them to expect to be fed as the fowles of the aire that neither ſowe nor reap; or to be cloathed as the Lillies of the field, that neither ſpin nor labour yet it doth ſo correct and allay the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all deſires towards the things of this world, as that they dare not take any way to gaine them, which the Word doth not warrant, or the promiſe ſanctify. Faith ſuggeſteth to them that it is not their labour, and care that makes rich, but <hi>Gods bleſſing,</hi> who giveth <hi>no ſorrow with it, Prov.</hi> 10. 22. That it is not their wiſdome that maketh their endeavours in their calling to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull; but Gods fidelity and truth that crownes them with proſperity: that it is not their ſweat that feeds the Lamp of their comforts, and makes it to ſhine; but the conſtant droppings and diſtillations of Gods goodneſſe. And thereby they are enabled to depend upon his promiſe, and to beleeve that ſuch a <hi>dimenſum,</hi> and portion of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115728:126"/> bleſſings ſhall be given unto them, as that they may truly ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Their lines are fallen unto them in pleaſant places; yea, they have a goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16. 6.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 3.</hi> Five aſsertions directing to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of temporall promiſes.</head>
                  <p>The third particular is the giving of rules for the right underſtanding of the nature of temporall promiſes, and the manner of due applying them unto our ſelves, which I ſhall ſet down in theſe five ſubſequent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that <hi>God declaration in his promiſes of giving temporall bleſſings, is not abſolute; but carries with it a tacit condition, and limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of expediency.</hi> The great and utmoſt end of all the promiſes, is one and the ſame with that which is the chief end of man, the fruition of God and communion with him in everlaſting bleſſedneſſe. Now the means that are ſubſervient to this end, are either ſuch as are of abſolute neceſſity, and do
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115728:126"/> immediately prepare and diſpoſe the ſoul for the obtaining of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or elſe ſuch as are leſſe requiſite, and have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely a remote and conſequentiall tendency thereunto; and that not of themſelves, but as they are over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, who makes <hi>Omnia cooperari in bonum,</hi> all things to work together for good, to them that love him. And of this kinde are all temporall bleſſings, proſperity, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, health, freedome, and the like. All which do (as I conceive) come no further under the verge of a promiſe, then as they conduce to the happineſſe of the other life; this life being onely a way and paſſage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; As the wilderneſſe was to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them to <hi>Canaan:</hi> Becauſe therefore none can know what is that meaſure of theſe outward comforts which moſt tends to the furtherance of their eternall happineſſe, which in and above all things ought to be eyed by them; It being haply more for their ſpirituall good, to have many advantages of this life in a leſſe degree rather then in a greater; to want them rather then to enjoy them: They cannot then in their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God ſeeke the abſolute perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promiſes in temporall bleſſings; but muſt refer themſelves to his wiſdome
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115728:127"/> and faithfulneſſe ſo to order and meaſure out the comforts of this life unto them, as may beſt ſtand with the welfare of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting condition, without which all earthly happineſſe is no other then a ſplendid miſery. But it is much otherwiſe in the bleſſings of grace, and holineſſe, which are things ſo eſſential to a beleevers fruition of God, as that <hi>without faith he cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>without holineſſe he cannot ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>without being born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. And being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo intrinſecally good in themſelves, ſo abſolutely alſo neceſſary unto ſalvation, they are in prayer to be moſt abſolutely ſought, as conſidered in their <hi>eſſence;</hi> but their <hi>degrees</hi> are arbitrary: God giving to ſome a leſſe, to others a greater meaſure of grace, according to his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Aſſertion is, that <hi>the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of temporal promiſes is diſjunctive,</hi> God either giving the bleſſing it ſelf, or that which is <hi>equivalent</hi> unto it. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God are all made in Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their certainty and ſtability from him in whom they are made, not from us to whom they are made: they are all ratified with
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115728:127"/> the ſame oath, and purchaſed by the ſame blood. And though they are not <hi>equally precious</hi> in regard of the things promiſed, yet they are <hi>equally true</hi> in regard of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their performance; onely the manner of their fulfilling is different. In the ſpiritual promiſes, God gives the things in kinde; for how can they be otherwiſe made good? What is anſwerable in worth or excellency to grace, the leaſt drop of which is of more value then the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. In <hi>temporals,</hi> God gives the things themſelves, or makes a compenſation ſome other way; If riches be asked of him in prayer, and yet denied, he makes it up in contentation, which brings that ſatisfaction with it, that riches cannot yield. If health be prayed for, and not granted; he gives ſtrength to beare the croſſe, by putting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his everlaſting armes. If deliverance in trouble be deſired, and not obtained; he gives the divine conſolations of Martyrs, which that Noble <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſia</hi> ſaid he found in his long and tedious impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in thus doing God doth not <hi>break</hi> his promiſe, but change it to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>That in the dayes of his fleſh, he offered up
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115728:128"/> prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi> That which Chriſt prayed for was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: <hi>O'Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me,</hi> Mat. 26. 39. Was there then any defect in Chriſts faith, in that he did not obtain the thing prayed ſor? Or how was his prayer heard? did he not die the death of the croſſe? was he not buried in the grave? Yes; but yet he had from God an anſwer of ſupportation, though not of deliverance. He was ſtrengthened in his agonie by the appearance of an Angel, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 43. He was aſſured by Gods promiſe of victorie over death, though not of freedome from it. He under-went the darkneſſe of the grave, but not the corruption of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10.</p>
                  <p>The third aſſertion is, that <hi>temporal promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are to be expounded with the reſervation, and exception of the Croſſe.</hi> God in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace (which is the adequate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his obligation to believers) hath kept to himſelf this prerogative of chaſtening the delinquencies of his children with rods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 33. of withdrawing his favours from them, when they with-hold their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115728:128"/> to him; of exerciſing the ſeverity of a Father, as well as the indulgency of a Mother. And therefore beleevers when they want the ſtaffe of many outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in their hand, and feel the ſmart of the rod of affliction upon their back, they are not to ſuſpect Gods fidelity in his promiſe; but to reflect upon themſelves, and by a ſerious diſquiſition to conſider from whence the ſuſpenſion of any good things that he hath promiſed doth ariſe. And if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under Gods re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ukes did make this their chief task, they would be ſo farre from charging him with unfaithfulneſſe, as that they would more wonder that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vouchſafe them any thing, that are Prodigals that juſtly deſerve nothing. In the midſt of their deepeſt trials they would ſay as the Church did in her extremities, <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Great is thy faithfulneſſe, O Lord,</hi> Lam. 3. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Aſſertion is, that <hi>temporal mercies in the promiſes are onely to be obtained by a well regulated prayer,</hi> in which God is ſought after a right manner, and the mercies begged for a right end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the manner of ſeeking God muſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115728:129"/> be in faith, <hi>James 1. 6. Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.</hi> But the faith here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, is not the faith of a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that God will give the very thing it ſelf that we begge of him; but the faith of ſubmiſſion by which we reſolve our prayers into his will, and beleeve that he will do whatever is beſt for our good and his glory. We then diſtruſt God when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are jealous of his willingneſſe to performe his Word, or of his power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his Word. But when we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the alſufficiency of his power, and reſigne our deſires to his will, we do then pray in faith. And this was the faith that our Lord Chriſt did put forth in his prayer, when he ſaid, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> Luk. 22. 42. I do not deny but that God may ſometimes aſſure, and incline the hearts of his children that are importunate wreſtlers in prayer, to be confident of granting the temporal bleſſing that they ſeek; but this is a confidence, that is rather begotten by the Spirit in the height and vigour of prayer, then brought with us unto the duty. Sometimes (I ſay) ſuch a confidence may be; but it is neither ordinary nor u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:115728:129"/>
                  <p>Secondly, temporal mercies muſt be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a right end, <hi>James 4. 3. Ye ask, and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſſe; that ye may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> Carnal luſts may make men eager in prayer, but not <hi>ſucceſſeful.</hi> Uſually wrong ends in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are accompanied with diſappointments. <hi>Siniſter Aimes</hi> turn duties of worſhip into acts of ſelf-ſeeking; they change the voice of prayer into a brutiſh howling, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. The execution of juſtice it ſelfe into murther, <hi>Hoſ. 1. 4. Finis in moralibus idem eſt, quod forma in naturalibus.</hi> The end in moral things, is the ſame that the forme is in natural things. The quality and goodneſſe of them is not diſcerned but by the end. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes therefore beleevers that would in prayer obtaine any outward bleſſing, to look unto their ends in asking of it: though the mercy be <hi>earthly,</hi> yet their end in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, muſt be <hi>heavenly.</hi> Gods glory muſt be in the end of all prayer, as his Name muſt be in the beginning of it, elſe it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it ſhould be owned as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by him.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Aſſertion is, that <hi>the bleſſings of temporal promiſes are to be ſought ſecondarily, and not primarily,</hi> Mat. 6. 33. They are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115728:130"/> to be the chief cares of our life, or deſires of our prayers: becauſe the ſoul may do well without the body; but the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do well without the ſoul. And yet of this diſorder the greateſt part of men may be found guilty. Their <hi>eſtates</hi> they carefully put into their <hi>deeds</hi> and evidences, and their <hi>ſouls</hi> they onely put into their <hi>wills,</hi> the laſt of inſtruments that are uſually either made or ſealed. For the one they think it enough, if with a few gilded expreſſions of piety, it be given and bequeathed as a legacy unto God. But for the other they conceive no paines or toile too great to encreaſe it; or coſt too much for to ſecure it. The one they make the task of the morning and day of their lives; the other the by-work of the evening, and the approaching night of death. So that it is no wonder if in theſe prepoſterous and irregular actings of men, they do not finde the bleſſing of Gods promiſe upon their labours; that they toil as in the fire, and weary themſelves for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vanity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 13. that they ſowe much, and bring in little, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6. For what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can they juſtly expect to reap from the promiſe, who neglect to walk by the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that rule to which the promiſe is made?</p>

               <p>And the firſt Application which I ſhall make, is; <hi>A ſad and just complaint</hi> (which ſighes and tears may better expreſſe then words,) <hi>of the great injury and contempt that is done unto the bleſſed promiſes,</hi> both by mens careleſſe and overly ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them as things of no great worth, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115728:131"/> by their ſinful perverting of them unto wrong ends and purpoſes, while they turn grace into wantonneſſe, and ſin the more freely becauſe of the redundancy of divine mercy which is manifeſted in them. God layes it as an heavy charge againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>he had written unto them the great things of his law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing,</hi> Hoſ. 8. 12.

Oh! how many Dullards hath holy <hi>David,</hi> or rather the holy Spirit to his harp, who are little affected with the heavenly melody that it makes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And may it not be as truly ſaid concerning the precious promiſes of Chriſt, Oh! how many are there that taſte little or nothing of their ſweetneſſe? What vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of men are there who ſee no more worth and beauty in them, then blinde perſons do in the Sunne? How many be there that ſpend and blaze away the lamp of their time in frothy ſtudies, and curious ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſeldome or never look into the Bible to read and underſtand what their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115728:132"/> or right is to the bleſſings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the promiſes? How ambitious are others to be thought to know much of the minde of God concerning his decrees, which are as a ſealed book; but neglect to ſee and know, both his will and love in the Goſpel, and the promiſes, which are as a book wide open, written in faire and legible characters for all to look into? In the one their travel and labour is fruitleſſe, like that of the <hi>Ants,</hi> which often climbe high trees to ſeek for food, but when they are at the top returne empty, not being able to bring any thing down with them. But in the other it would prove like that of the <hi>Bee,</hi> which ſeeks its aliment among fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant flowers, and failes not to returne to its hive laden with honey. O! that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who ſeem to converſe with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes more then others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were not guilty of this great ſinne, while they only read and ſtudy them as Lawyers do other mens evidences and titles of land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any reſpects of being proprietaries themſelves. Or elſe are (as <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſſeth it) like the teeth, <hi>qui toti corpori maſticant cibum, &amp; nullum indè ſaporem habent:</hi> Which chew meat for the whole body; but derive no
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115728:132"/> ſweetneſſe from it, that may delight or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them. Oh! that many who look upon themſelves as true heires of the promiſes, were not injurious to the worth and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, while they make the ſucceſſe of <hi>Providences</hi> the warrant of the goodneſſe of their actions, rather then the ſtability of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> which in all undertakings are the ſureſt guides for to direct, and the beſt comforters for to encourage. It is the obſervation of <hi>Sulpicius</hi> concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Jews, that <hi>Semper in ſecundis rebus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memores coelestium beneficiorum, idolis ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabant, in adverſis Deo:</hi> Alwayes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity being unmindfull of heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they did worſhip idols, and in their adverſity the true God. And ſo it may be ſaid concerning many profeſſors in theſe preſent times, that in external ſucceſſes and proſperous events, they altogether adore and extoll providences; but when theſe frown upon them, or grow cloudy, then they betake themſelves to promiſes.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond aggravation is from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and emptineſſe of thoſe things which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115728:133"/> moſt men ſet their hearts upon. The minde of man is the ſupreme and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty of the ſoul, indued by God with ſuch abilities, and graces which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly declare that earthly things can no more ſatisfie it, or fill it, then the breath of the mariners can fill the ſailes; And therefore God hath provided for it ſuitable objects, on which it may exerciſe both its natural power, and the ſupernatural habits which by his Spirit he infuſeth into it, with fulneſſe of delight and ſatisfaction. He hath in his Word revealed high myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which the glorious Angels do deſire to prie into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. in the contemplation of which the minde of beleevers may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fruitfully buſied; And he hath alſo made precious promiſes both of grace and glory, on which their faith may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt, and from which it may derive more ſweetneſſe and contentment in one houre, then the fruition of all earthly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will ever be able to yield in a ſucceſſion of ages. And yet how apt are beleevers as well as others to let their thoughts to fix and dwell on theſe empty things that are below; rather then to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and delight themſelves in the knowledge
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115728:133"/> of theſe divine and Angelical objects? How often do they more reſemble in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were ſcattered abroad throughout the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraw and ſtubble, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 12. then the wiſe Merchant that ſpent his time in ſeeking of goodly pearles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45. And do they not by ſuch prepoſterous and irregular actings greatly undervalue, and highly diſhonour the precious things of the Goſpel? Do they not by thus walking make themſelves inhabitants of the world, rather then pilgrims and ſtrangers that ſeek and deſire an heavenly countrey? Oh! therefore let me prevail with you who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God hath provided better things for you then others, to be exceeding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and cautious, that you let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lie neerer your hearts, or take up more of your thoughts, then the promiſes of life and glory; the expectation of which yields at preſent the beſt comfort, and their fruition the moſt abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect happineſſe.</p>

                  <p>A third aggravation is from the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and uncertainty of all thoſe things which do take off the moſt men both from ſeeking after the promiſes and from valuing of them according to their worth. It is a true poſition of <hi>Leſſius</hi> in his divine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that <hi>Aeternitas efficit bonum infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè melius, &amp; malum infinitè pejus: Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Aeviternity do make a good infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better, and an evil infinitely worſe.</hi> And in this reſpect the good things which are held forth in the promiſes, do farre excell all earthly riches or grandure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; which in their greateſt ability are both ſhort and mutable. Can any man ſay that the wilde fowle in his grounds are his, which ſuddenly take their wings and flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and for a while make a ſtay in another mans field, and thereby give a like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety unto the ſecond, as they did unto the firſt? No more can any man call rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es truly his, which like to winged birds ſhift their owners, and haſte from one to another. Have not the preſent times furniſhed us with inſtances in this kinde even to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115728:134"/> Have we not ſeen the glory of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſtained with ignominy? Have not thoſe that dwelt in ſtately Manſions become as Cottagers, and they that ſate in low places been inveſted in ſtately Manſions? Have we not beheld the evil that <hi>Solomon</hi> complains of, <hi>Eccleſ. 10. 7. Servants upon horſes, and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth?</hi> And yet who is there that by all theſe changes is awakened to get evidences that will not burn, riches that cannot be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, an inheritance that cannot be ſhaken? Oh! how greedily do men ſtill purſue the fleeting vanities, and neglect the true riches that endure for ever?</p>

                  <head>SECT. 4.</head>
                  <p>A fourth aggravation is from the facility of being made partakers of the promiſes: they are precious, but not difficult, the termes upon which they are tendred ſerve rather to invite then to deterre. We need not <hi>ſay in our heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven to bring down Christ from above? Or, who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead? the word is nigh unto us,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115728:135"/> if pearles which lie at the bottome of ſteep rocks, have but few adventurers for them, becauſe the danger may be more then the gain; if gold in remote countreys and deep mines be not travelled for, and digged out of the bowels of the earth: But it may be juſtly wondred at, and cenſured as the higheſt folly, if men coming to a full heap of treaſures be invited to throw away the clay &amp; dirt with which their hands are filled, &amp; the ſuperfluities with which they are load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to take of gold and pearl as much as they can carry, ſhould refuſe to do the one, that they might thereby be enabled to do the other. What is it elſe that God and Chriſt do require of men to the receiving of the promiſes, but only that they would disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves of earthly incumbrances which hinder the reception of ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that ſo with hearts emptied of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections and cares they may be qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the fulneſſe of heavenly riches? When <hi>Joſeph</hi> invited his father and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to come down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he bids them <hi>not to regard their ſtuffe; for the good of all the land of</hi> Egypt <hi>is yours,</hi> Gen. 45. 20. So the true heavenly <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to come unto him, he bids them
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115728:135"/> not to ſet their hearts on things on the earth; becauſe all the riches of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are before them, and by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made over to them. How inexcuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then muſt their neglect be who do not with anſwerable hearts and deſires em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch precious offers.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 5.</head>
                  <p>A fifth aggravation is taken from the command of God and Chriſt. We are not onely invited to take hold of the promiſes; but we are commanded to believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of them. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is his commandment that we ſhould beleeve on the Name of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 3. 23. That is, we ought ſo to beleeve his promiſes, his ſayings, as to count them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation. As we aſſent unto them for their truth; ſo are we to embrace them for their preciouſneſſe and worth. Our faith muſt work by love; it muſt put forth it ſelf in the ſtrength of all affection by our eſteeming and prizing of them above the moſt deſirable things of the world. Thus <hi>David</hi> did when he ſaid, <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever; for they are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115728:136"/> the rejoycings of my heart,</hi> Pſalm. 119. 111. Gods promiſes he made as his <hi>lands,</hi> as his <hi>goods,</hi> as his <hi>all.</hi> They were more dear to him then all his temporal things whatſoever. When therefore they are not thus honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the hearts, and in the lives of beleevers, the great Commandment of the Goſpel is violated, the diſobedience of which will be recompenced with more heavy and ſore judgements, then the breaches of the Law.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Application from this truth, That the promiſes of the Goſpel are precious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be <hi>to acquaint us with the wide differences that are between the promiſes of God, and the promiſes of the Devil,</hi> who is the great deceiver of the whole world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. Sinne which Satan by all his arts endeavoureth to make men guilty of, that ſo they may be as miſerable as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115728:136"/> is in it ſelf ſo full of deformity and uglineſſe, as that if it were but ſeen in its true ſhape, there could not be a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual argument to keep men from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it then its own monſtroſity. There are three things ſay the School that cannot be defined, <hi>Dei formoſitas, materiae primae infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas, &amp; peccati deformitas:</hi> The Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and beauty of God, the informity of the firſt matter, and the deformity of ſin. Now to hide and cover this misſhapen mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Satan uſeth not a few devices: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he makes it to appear in the habit and likeneſſe of a vertue, and thus he tempts men to covetouſneſſe under the notion of frugality; to riot and prodigality under the colour of liberality. Sometimes he varniſheth it with the ſpecious ſhews of profit, and gaine, and promiſeth large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to them that will but comply with his ſuggeſtions and counſels. And this is one of the moſt ſubtil artifices that he uſeth to withdraw a man from any good, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and winne him to any ſin. Thus he tempted <hi>Balaam</hi> to venture upon the curſing of Gods people by the promiſe of honour and preferment, <hi>Micha's Levite</hi> with a ſmall augmentation of his ſtipend promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115728:137"/> unto him, he tempted both to theft and idolatry; <hi>Judas</hi> upon the promiſe of thirty pieces of ſilver, which the inſtruments of the devil make unto him, he tempts to ſell the life and blood of his bleſſed Maſter, yea, by a franke and large promiſe of all the kingdomes of the world; he tempts our Lord and Saviour to the higheſt act of idolatry that is imaginable, to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: not deſpairing by the greatneſſe of the offer to hide the foulneſſe of the ſinne, though it be with ſcorne and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation rejected by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. Becauſe therefore that the moſt of men are ready to be deceived by the ſpeciouſneſſe of the devils promiſes, and to give more heed to what he ſpeaks, then to the good Word of God. I ſhall in four particulars ſet forth the difference between the promiſes of God, and the promiſes of Satan.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>the difference between the perſons that make them.</hi> Promiſes are like bonds which depend altogether upon the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the ſurety. If a beggar ſeal to an inſtrument for the payment of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, who eſteems it to be any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a blank? But if a man of eſtate and ability do bind himſelf to pay ſuch a ſum, it is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115728:137"/> looked upon as ſo much real eſtate, and men dovalue themſelves by ſuch bills and bonds as well as by what is in their own poſſeſſion. God who hath made rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to beleevers, is able to performe what he hath ſpoken. <hi>He is rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. <hi>Abundant in goodneſse and truth,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. <hi>He is the God of truth,</hi> Pſalm. 31. 5. <hi>The Father of mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 3. But the devil is a <hi>Beggar,</hi> an outcaſt, one that hath nothing in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> nothing in <hi>diſpoſition.</hi> He is <hi>a lyar, and the father of it,</hi> John 8. 44. <hi>A deceiver,</hi> Revel. 12. 9. <hi>A murtherer from the beginning,</hi> who killed not one, but all in one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. How then can his promiſes be a foundation of ſupport to any, that have no other word to build upon but his? He hath never kept his promiſe, and God hath never broke his promiſe. <hi>There hath not failed one word of all his good promiſe, which he promiſed by the hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>his ſervant,</hi> 1 Kings 56.</p>
               <p>A ſecond difference is <hi>in the matter of the promiſes.</hi> Let us weigh the promiſes of the one and of the other in the balance of truth, and we ſhall finde that the promiſes of God are <hi>gold,</hi> and the promiſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are <hi>Alchimy,</hi> ſuch which though they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115728:138"/> glitter much, have no worth or excellency in them. Or, that they are, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the Rainbowe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an appearance only, and not like the cloud, which he ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a true and real ſubſtance. God's, are ſubſtantial realities, and his, vaniſhing and fleeting ſhadows windy and ſwollen blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which but a little prickt, do quickly fall and grow lank. <hi>Stobaeus</hi> out of <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> tels a ſtory of one <hi>Archetimus,</hi> who had depoſited moneys in the hand of <hi>Cydias</hi> his friend, who afterwards requiring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of him; he denied the receiving any. And being thereupon cited before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for want of other proof, it was reſolved that the matter ſhould be determined by a ſolemn oath: A day for which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Cydias</hi> faining illneſſe, provides him an hallow ſtaffe, into which he put the gold, and while he went to the Altar to ſweare, he gave his ſtaffe into the hand of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> to hold; and then ſwore that he had received moneys of him, but he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them again, <hi>Archetimus</hi> being much incenſed both by his impudence and his own loſſe, flings down the ſtaffe with ſuch violence upon the ground, that it brake into pieces, and the money in it ſcattered
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115728:138"/> abroad, whereby <hi>Cydias</hi> his fraud was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected. And this the Hiſtorian calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, A lie made up of art and ſubtilty, ſuch are all Satans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they are nothing but well tempered and fine ſpun lies, gilded impoſtures, cheats framed on purpoſe to deceive: The matter of them is falſe, as well as the end of them is deceitful.</p>
               <p>A third difference is <hi>in the ground of the promiſes.</hi> Gods promiſes do ariſe from his love and good will to thoſe to whom they are made, and are the powerful motives by which he winnes and draws men to the obedience of himſelf: But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans promiſes do flow from his irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred of God, and his envying of mans happineſſe which God by Chriſt hath freely eſtated upon him: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare that God ſhould have any to worſhip him, or to love him, and therefore he uſeth all wayes that malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy can prompt unto him to draw and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice men from him. As God uſeth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to oblige and tye men to himſelf as by ſo many ſtrong cords and bands of love: So Satan on the contrary makes uſe of his promiſes to alienate mens hearts and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115728:139"/> affections from God, and to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage to himſelf: His great end by all theſe ſpecious artifices of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing honour, riches, pleaſure, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be a bait to carnal hearts, is at once to deprive God of his glory, and man of his happineſſe. His promiſes are as the meat which fowlers ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore birds, which is not to feed them, but to take them.</p>
               <p>A fourth difference is <hi>in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Gods promiſes are alwayes like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rich and ſeaſonable harveſt, which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers the hopes and expectation of the husband-man: they who wait upon him have never their faces covered with ſhame, nor their hearts dejected with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. He is as <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Verax in promiſſione, potens in exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione:</hi> Faithful in promiſing, powerful in performing. <hi>God who cannot lie hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. But as God is alwayes righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in keeping his word; ſo Satan is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes falſe in breaking his word: If he promiſe bread, he gives a ſtone; if fiſh, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; if riches, poverty. <hi>Remigius</hi> who was a Judge in <hi>Florence,</hi> and had many witches under his examination, reports that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115728:139"/> divers of them have confeſſed that the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gold and money which they received of him, when it came to be uſed, proved either leaves or ſand; not above the value of three ſtivers, was ever found to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money; And indeed how can it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be expected? When ſuch is his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred unto all man kinde, as that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeeks their ruine, and not their welfare? Can any man rationally conceive that he ſhould deal better with him, then with our firſt Parents? In propounding the temptation he makes a ſhew of friendſhip; but in the cloſe he proves a bloody liar. What other thing did they behold by his opening of their eyes, but their own ſhame, and folly in hearkening unto his deceitful words? What other knowledge did they gain; but only the ſad experience of the tranſitorineſſe of ſinful pleaſures, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh as ſoon as they are taſted, and prove to be not food, but poyſon.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that in all theſe reſpects there is ſo wide a difference between Gods promiſes, and the Devils: Oh! then how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable is their ſin who by the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and effaſcinations of Satan are drawn aſide to give more credit unto his bare
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115728:140"/> word, then to the promiſes of God that are ratified with his oath, and Chriſts blood. What higher contumely and ſcorne can any put upon God, then by their unbelief to make him a liar; and that in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to have more regard to what Satan the father of lies ſpeaks, then to what God who is the Father of mercies ſweares? And yet in this kinde God ſuffers diſhonour from more then a few. How great is the number of thoſe who upon the appearance of the leaſt difficulty are apt to be jealous of his faithfulneſſe, and through diſtruſt to wave the waiting upon him in his promiſe, for the obtaining of ſome particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and betake themſelves unto ſuch wayes as Satan ſecretly ſuggeſts to them, to be both more compendious, and certain? And what is this leſſe then to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively guilty, if not formally of ſo foul a ſin, as the making of the moſt holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God a liar? Let me therefore in a few words prevail with all thoſe that profeſſe to the world to have their dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and to derive their comforts from his promiſes, to be circumſpect how they comply with any way or means for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of their deſires, that may be

To ſpeak well (ſaith <hi>Iſiodorus Pelutiota</hi>) is to ſound like a Cymbal; but to do well is to act like an Angel. It is not a beleevers work onely to ſpeak well of the promiſes, but to act faith in them; and when through diffidence he ſteps aſide into any unwarrantable path, he then gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion unto worldly and carnal men to think and ſpeak as ſlightly of Gods promiſes, as he at other times hath ſpoken unto the world of the deceitfulneſſe and inconſtancy of the promiſes of Satan.</p>

This corollary though it be a truth which all contradiction can no more ſhake, then the violence of tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous waves can ſtirre the rocks againſt which they daſh and break; yet it hath ſo much of a Paradox in it, that from the moſt part of men it may finde no better entertainment then <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine of the reſurrection did at <hi>Athens,</hi> where he hath no better title given to him by the grand Sophies of the Epicureans and Stoicks, then <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Firſt, a believer haply is in the world in no better condition then a ſtranger that hath little or no intereſt in its enfranchiſements, priviledges and immunities which others daily finde the ſweet of, in the many benefits that they enjoy: He is frowned upon when others are courted and ſmiled upon by thoſe that have honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s and preferments in their power to beſtow. He lives like <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under hard preſſures, when others rule and reigne as Lords. He is friendleſſe, and findes none either to pity his wrongs, or to do him the leaſt right. To his words, to his ſighs he finds a deaf and regardleſſe ear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually turned, when others have the Law open, where they may implead their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and have friends that are willing to countenance them, and ready to help them. Can he then that wants all theſe things, be more happy then he who enjoyes them? Yes, for though a believer be a ſtranger here below<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he is a Citizen of the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which is above, to which every worldly man is a forreigner, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12.

God as a Father, Chriſt as a Brother, and the holy Spirit as a Comforter; All whom the men of the world can call by no ſuch titles.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115728:143"/> and much more is acknowledged to be the lot and portion of many Chriſtians, ſuch of whom the world is not worthy. But yet let us view their condition, ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the men of the world, whoſe bellies are filled with hid treaſure, and we ſhall quickly ſee that a true judgement and eſtimate being made of both; that the thornes of the one will ſmell ſweeter, then the roſes of the other: his neceſſities will be more deſirable, then their fulneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wants ſanctified are better then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified enjoyments. All their morſels are rolled up in the filth of their ſin, and in the bitterneſſe of Gods malediction: and all his wants are both ſweetened and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the comforts of Gods promiſes. Though he hath nothing for the preſent, yet he is rich in hopes. Though he have nothing in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> yet he hath an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, a Kingdome, a Crown in <hi>reverſion.</hi> They have all their good things in this life, and he hath his reſerved for the other. Though he have no food for his body, yet he hath Manna for his ſoul. He hath an hungry body, and they a ſtarved ſoul. Though he have here ſcarce a place to lay his head on, yet is there roome reſerved for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115728:143"/> him in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, where he ſhall for ever dwell in joy, when others lie down in ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. Though his body be as a parched wilderneſſe for thirſt, yet his ſoul is as a watred garden, <hi>Out of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow rivers of living water,</hi> John. 7. 38. We may truly ſay of a beleever what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf; though he was poor, yet he had enough to make many rich; though he had nothing, yet he poſſeſſed all things. <hi>Fideli homini totus mundus divitiarum eſt, infideli autem nec obolus:</hi> To a Chriſtian all the world is his riches, to an unbeliever not a doit of it, ſaith <hi>Proſper.</hi> There is no creature which doth not owe an homage unto him, and ſhall certainly pay it, if his neceſſities do require it. <hi>The heavens ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the corne and the wine and the oyle in anſwer to</hi> Jezreel'<hi>s prayers,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 21, 22. What is at further diſtance then the heavens, and ſo more unlikely to hear then heavens? What creature more dull then earth, and ſo more unmeet to be affected and moved with a cry? And yet both the heavens and the earth ſhall not be deaf to <hi>Jezreel</hi>'s prayers, but ſhall fulfill their deſires, and ſupply their wants.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, a beleever is not onely exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the preſſing evils of want &amp; pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but he oftentimes lies under the ſore burthen of reproach and obloquie, which to an ingenuous ſpirit is more bitter then death itſelf. He is the common mark to which all the ſharp arrows of mens tongues are directed. He is the onely perſon that is taken up in the lips of talkers, and is the infamy of the people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 3. When others are in their name as beautiful as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> who from the ſole of his foot to the crown of his head, had no blemiſh in him; he is as <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghill overſpread with defamations that are as ſo many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ulcers. When others are cried up as the glory of their times, he is decried as the filth, and off-ſcouring of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. When the actions of others are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned as their vertues, his that are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves commendable are cenſured as full of pride, hypocriſy, affectation and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. Where is then the bleſſedneſſe of his condition that you ſpake of? How can his eſtate that is overcaſt with a more pitchy
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115728:144"/> darkneſſe then that of the night, be better then the beſt of theirs that hath not the leaſt ſhadow of any ſuch evil ſtretching out it ſelf upon it? True it is that none are more evil ſpoken of, and blaſted in their names then beleevers; but the ground of it ſprings not from their juſt deſervings; but from the worlds malice and enmity to God, which is derived to them for his ſake. Let <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the Jews ſet upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building of the Temple, and the repairing of the waſte place of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullat</hi> upbraids them with intentions of rebellion, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 6. Let <hi>Paul</hi> make known the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Jews that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, cry out, that he is one of them that turn the world upſide-down, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 6. Let the primitive Chriſtians that cannot ſafely meet in the day, take the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the night to worſhip God, and the Heathens aſperſe their Aſſemblies to be full of uncleanneſſe and cruelty, and that they have ſuppers not much unlike that of <hi>Thiestes,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews in his <hi>Apology.</hi> Now in theſe ſufferings for God, there are ſuch promiſes from God made and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them, as that there is more ſweetneſs to be found in the reproaches that they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115728:145"/> undergo for him from the world, then there can be contentment in its ſmiles or favour. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reproaches with <hi>Iſrael</hi> then to enjoy treaſures in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies &amp; ſlanders which they undergo on Chriſts behalf, ſerve both to make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comforts more ſweet, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter more glorious. <hi>Bleſſed are ye</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſpeak all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil againſt you falſely for my Names ſake. Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven,</hi> Mat. 10. 11.</p>
                  <p>And now ſpeak, O ye worldlings, that judge happineſſe by as falſe a rule, as they do that meaſure their height by their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Who is in a true eſtimate the better man, <hi>Elijah</hi> that runs before the chariot, or <hi>Ahab</hi> that ſits in it? <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> that is cloathed with camels haire, or <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; his Courtiers that are arrayed with robes and coſtly garments? the poor whom God hath choſen to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdome, <hi>James</hi> 2. 5. or the man that hath the gold ring, and hath the chief place in Aſſemblies given unto him?

To be rich to God, and poor to men, or to be rich to men, and poore to God. To be the favorite of heaven, and to be contemned on earth, or to be the darling of earth, and the enemy of heaven?

               <p>A Fourth application is to exhort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers that are made partakers of ſuch great and precious promiſes, <hi>to abound in all thankfulneſſe to God and Chriſt, who are the ſole fountain from whence theſe ſtreams of living waters do flow.</hi> When old <hi>Iſaac</hi> had eaten of his ſonnes veniſon, he bleſſed him
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115728:146"/> that had prepared it for him: how much more ſhould they that have taſted how good God is, have their mouthes filled with the bleſſing and praiſing of his Name, that hath poured forth his love and mercy in ſuch rich promiſes, as are to the ſoul more ſweet then marrow and fatneſſe? To this duty holy <hi>David</hi> doth quicken and ſtirre up himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. when he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons all the faculties of his ſoul to praiſe the Lord; <hi>Let all that is within me bleſſe his holy Name,</hi> Verſ. 1. And that he may make the deeper impreſſions of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon his own heart, he frames a ſhort, but yet a pithy <hi>compendium</hi> of his love towards him, in his pardoning and healing grace, <hi>Verſ. 3. He forgiveth all thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> In his redeeming and ſaving grace, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4. He redeemeth thy life from <hi>deſtruction, and crowneth thee with loving kindneſſe, and tender mercies.</hi> In his ſupporting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing mercies, <hi>Verſ. 5. He ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things: thy youth is renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the eagles.</hi> And of all theſe bleſſings are beleevers made partakers in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; it therefore becomes them to pay unto God a tribute of thankfulneſſe, and that upon theſe grounds.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:115728:146"/>
               <p>Firſt, the end of Gods goodneſſe to his creatures is his glory, and that which he chiefly delights in. Trumpeters love to ſound where there is an echo; and God loves to beſtow his mercies where he may hear of them again. For man to make the end of his actions in any kinde to be his own praiſe, doth not onely taint and flie-blow his ſervices with hypocriſie, and pride, ſo as to marre the beauty of them, but alſo transformes them into vices that are hateful unto God and man: For it is not meet that he who derives his being from another, ſhould have his actions to terminate in himſelf. He that gives the being, gives alſo the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of its working, by both which the goodneſſe of its actions are denominated. The rule of its working is the law and will of him who gave it a being, and the end of all its acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is his glory. But God who is the fountain of his own being, can have in all his works no other end then his own praiſe and glory. This is his end in all his works of creation, <hi>Prov. 16. 4. The Lord made all things for himſelf.</hi> And this is the great end of all his works of grace in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 6. That we ſhould be to the praiſe of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115728:147"/> the glory of his grace.</hi> All the eternal purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God concerning mans ſalvation from the firſt to the laſt, do ultimately reſolve themſelves into his glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to give unto God praiſe, and thankful acknowledgements for his great and precious promiſes, is all the return that we can make. <hi>David</hi> as a man truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his many, and deep obligations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, hath a great conſultation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which way he ſhould expreſſe his thankfulneſſe unto him; <hi>What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> Pſalm. 116. 12. But after all muſings and ſtudyings with himſelf he can finde no other way but this: <hi>I will take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord, Verſ.</hi> 13. An Euchariſtical ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving is all that <hi>David,</hi> though a King, can finde to give unto God: And this kinde of payment the poor may make as well as the rich, the young as well as the old. The children in the Goſpel can cry <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> Mat. 21. 15. as well as others. It is a good obſervation of <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> that God hath equalized all men in that ability which moſt recommends or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115728:147"/> diſcommends them unto him, and that is the ability of the will, to love him and to give him praiſe. This is that which all may do who have taſted how good God is, and this is all that the beſt can do, who have been moſt filled with the riches of his mercy. Seeing therefore that a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recognition of Gods love and bounty in his promiſes, is the onely recompence that we can make; it is moſt meet that we ſhould abound in it, and make it not only the duty of our lips, but of our hearts, breathing forth our very ſouls in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual praiſes of him, who hath manifeſted the gracious purpoſes of his heart unto us in many rich promiſes of life and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. More then this, God in his <hi>mercy</hi> doth not deſire: and leſſe then this in all <hi>reaſon</hi> we cannot give.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the giving of God praiſe and glory in endleſſe ſongs of thankſgiving, is the onely work of the Saints in heaven; when fully made partakers of all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that the promiſes do hold forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is now the continual bleſſed exerciſe of all the inhabitants of thoſe everlaſting Manſions in the higheſt heavens; and it ſhall be ours, when we ſhall be tranſlated thither,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115728:148"/> and have our <hi>faith</hi> turned into <hi>viſion,</hi> and our <hi>hope</hi> into <hi>enjoyment.</hi> Requiſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that what we know muſt be our eternal <hi>exerciſe</hi> in <hi>heaven,</hi> to make that our frequent <hi>practice</hi> on <hi>earth.</hi> Thoſe perſons that intend to travel into remote and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countreys with an advantage unto themſelves, do before-hand acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the cuſtomes, manners, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of the place to which they go, and from others whoſe experience may give the beſt light, do inquire what is the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and diſpoſition of the natives, that ſo they may the better comply with their formes and civilities, yea, they endeavour to get ſome ſmattering of the language, that they may not be altogether ſtrangers to what is done and ſpoken there: So ſhould Chriſtians, who expect to dwell with the Lord for ever, with all diligence inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the work and ſervices of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Angels, and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to get ſome rudiments of their heavenly language while they are below; that ſo they may the better bear a part in that celeſtial quire, ſinging with a loud voice, <hi>Bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdome, and thankſgiving,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115728:148"/> and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 7. 12.</p>
               <p>Now that this duty of thankfulneſſe may run in a right channel, I ſhall in ſome few particulars ſhew how it may, and ought to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let thankfulneſſe appear in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that exhortation of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God.</hi> The promiſes as they are cauſes working holineſſe, ſo alſo are they Arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing to it, being for the moſt part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as rewards unto the obedience of faith, which is a purifying and cleanſing grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. In what more genuine fruits therefore can thankfulneſſe manifeſt it ſelf, then in holineſſe? Or how can a beleever better evidence his high eſteeme of the promiſes, then by his continual preſſing forward to the perfection of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity? Now as <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us in the firſt book of his <hi>Rhetoricks,</hi> that there are two wayes by which men grow rich; either <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their preſent ſtore; or elſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:115728:149"/> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking away from their expenſes. So alſo holineſſe is perfected by a double meanes, either by the addition of one grace unto another, which is the duty that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls for, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Adde to your faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godlineſse, &amp;c.</hi> Or elſe by not making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof, which is the counſel that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. And he that doth not both theſe wayes endeavour the increaſe of holineſſe, ſtarving the boundleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the fleſh, and ſtrengthening the graces of the Spirit by renuing acts of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, can never be rich either in grace or comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let thankfulneſſe for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be expreſſed, in proclaiming that mercy, ſalvation and aſſured peace which you have received from them. If ſo be you have taſted that God is good, do as the birds, which when they come to a full heap chirp, and invite their fellows. Tell the <hi>hungry</hi> ſoul what ſatisfying and bleſſed <hi>food</hi> the promiſes are: the <hi>dejected,</hi> what
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115728:149"/> reviving <hi>cordials:</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> what enduring <hi>riches:</hi> the <hi>broken,</hi> and wounded, what heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>balſoms</hi> they are; that ſo they may be encouraged to take hold of theſe promiſes by an hand of faith. Criples that returne with health from the Bathe, hang up their crutches on the trees, and their rags on the hedges that are near, that thereby they may win credit and eſteeme to the waters. And ſo to honour the Wells of ſalvation ſhould Chriſtians make known the great things that God hath done for them, and leave in every place where they come ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their thankfulneſſe, and Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) all ye that feare the Lord, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 66. 16. He doth not call them (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves) to acquaint them with ſpeculations how wide the earth is, how farre the heavens are ſtretched out, what the number of the ſtarres is, or what is the courſe of the Sunne; but come and I will tell you the wonders of his grace, the faithfulneſſe of his promiſes, the riches of his mercy to my ſoul. Oh! that Believers would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to declare thus the experiences that they have any time had of Gods truth and power in his Word, and in a way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115728:150"/> to communicate them unto others. How inſtrumental might they thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the comforting and eſtabliſhing of others? Experiences are like milk in the breaſt of the Nurſe, that hath received a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and is thereby made a more facil and pure nouriſhment to the childe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let thankfulneſſe for the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes be expreſſed, <hi>in a most affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate bleſsing of God, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom all that is wrapt up in them is given unto us.</hi> He is the firſt matter as it were, out of which God hath framed all our good. He is the receptacle in which all bleſſings are laid up, and the Well-head from whence they all flow. By his blood the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are purchaſed for us, and by his moſt powerful interceſſion they are made good unto us. Alas! how little efficacy would all our prayers have, if they were not preſented to God the Father by his hand? How ſmall acceptance would our perſons finde, if God did not look upon us in him? How uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine would all our comforts be, if the root of them were not in him, if he were not as the tree of life upon which they grow? Yea, how quickly ſhould we ſpie an hell that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115728:150"/> might amaze us, between heaven, and any other ground of confidence that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be imagined by us out of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When therefore we do at any time make a thankful recognition of Gods goodneſſe to us in the particular mercies of the promiſes of the Goſpel, let us be ſure to put the Name of Chriſt to all: When we bleſſe God for blotting out our iniquities, for pardoning freely all our ſins, let us ſet this crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the mercy, that he hath done it in Chriſt. When we bleſſe him for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of us, let us ever adde for his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying us in Chriſt. When we praiſe him for our Adoption and Sonſhip, let us bleſſe him for doing of it in Chriſt. When we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him for the aſſured hopes of life and glory in heaven, let us ſay as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Christ,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let thankfulneſſe for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes appear <hi>in ſtrong deſires, and vehement pantings after the plenary poſſeſſion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enjoyment of all that felicity, of which they are the earneſts and pledges given us by God.</hi> In this life we are but as Kings in the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115728:151"/> Cradle, the ſetting of the crowne upon our heads is reſerved till we come to heaven. Here we are but as eſpouſed perſons, and not as the Bride in her beſt clothes; in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life we put on the robes of glory, which ſhall make our bodies ſhine ten thouſand times brighter then the Sun, and our ſouls ten thouſand times brighter then our bodies. Here we are but as invited gueſts to the feaſt, and ſupper of the great King; we ſit not down at his table till we come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and then Chriſt bids us <hi>eate, O friends, and drink abundantly O beloved.</hi> While therefore we are abſent from the Lord, and do by the eye of faith only peep into the things that are within the vaile, and enjoy a few foretaſts of glory and immortality; we ſhould ſhew how highly we prize the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, by longing after, and wiſhing for the final accompliſhment of all. Oh! when will it be that I ſhall ſee him in whoſe blood I was waſhed, by whoſe ſtripes I was healed, by whoſe Spirit I was ſanctified, by whoſe merits ſuch great things are prepared for me? How long, Lord, holy and true, will it be ere death ſhall be ſwallowed up in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and mortality put on immortality? Thus <hi>Bernard</hi> upon thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115728:151"/> 
                  <hi>(John 16. 16. A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again, a little while and ye ſhall ſee me,)</hi> paſſionately expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Pie Domine, modicum illud vocas in quo te non videam? O modicum, modicum lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum!</hi> Good Lord, doſt thou call that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, in which I ſhall not ſee thee? O long, long little! Such deſires as theſe are true evidences of a thankful heart.</p>

               <p>THE fifth and laſt application is, to ſtir up Believers to act <hi>precious faith</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.) upon the <hi>precious promiſes:</hi> without which, what are the promiſes in the Word, but as ſugar in the wine, that lying unſtired, doth not ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but as full breaſts undrawn, that do not nouriſh; but as beds of ſpices, that being unblown upon, do not lend forth their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and delightful odours? It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and skill of faith that fetcheth out the vertue and ſweetneſſe which lies h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:115728:152"/> as it is the induſtry of the Bee that extracts the honey from the flowers. The Bee would ſtarve notwithſtanding all the flowery mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, if it did not labour: and ſo would a Chriſtian languiſh and pine away notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the precious promiſes, if faith ſhould be idle and unactive. O then that I might prevaile with Believers to caſt aſide every weight that hindereth, and to ſet on work this noble and divine grace of faith, whoſe glory and worth is not to be ſeene in the habit; but in the acts of it. What doth <hi>Samſon</hi> differ from another man while he ſleeps in the lap of <hi>Dalilah?</hi> But when he awakes out of his ſleep, and breaks the withs and cords that bound him, as a thread of towe when it toucheth the fire, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away the beam and the web in which his locks are faſtened; then his ſtrength ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its greatneſſe to be matchleſſe. And ſo in what is a Believer diſtinguiſhed from another man, while the habit of faith lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in his boſome, and is not actuated on the promiſes? But when it ſtirs, and rouſeth up it ſelf to take hold of God and Chriſt in his Word, how apparent is the ſtrength of the one, and the weakneſſe of the other made to every eye? What burthens doth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115728:152"/> the one ſtand under and carry away upon his ſhoulders under which the other ſinks? what temptations doth the one overcome, unto which the other without reſiſtance yields? What viper doth the one ſhake off his hand into the fire without the leaſt hurt, which faſten upon the other, and ſting him unto death? It is faith which makes us to rejoyce in tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3. It is faith which maketh us to poſſeſſe our ſouls in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence infiery trials, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. It is faith which makes us reſolute in deſertions, <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 4. It is faith which makes every condition of life comfortable, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>But that I may yet more fully proſecute this exhortation which hitherto is as a veſſel upon the wheel of the Potter that hath not received it perfect ſhape: I ſhall propound ſome particular arguments and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may animat Believers to live the life of faith, which ſtands chiefly in two things. Firſt, in a knowledge of, and a familiar acquaintance with the Word, ſo as to have it in readineſſe for direction. Secondly, in a right improvement and exerciſe of faith on the Word and promiſes of God. For as faith is truly the life and guide of the ſoul; ſo the Word is the ground, life and guide of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115728:153"/> our faith. Now the Arguments that I ſhall ſet down, are briefly three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The life of faith is that life which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, God would have Believers to live:</hi> And this appears by the diſtance that God hath put between his promiſes and his performances, making their whole life to be rather a life of hopes, then of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the good things that he gives to relate more to the future, then to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. God was graciouſly pleaſed to open a door of hope to fallen man in that firſt Goſpel-promiſe which he himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. that the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould break the Serpents head.</hi> But how many generations paſſed away, before the fulneſſe of time came, in which he ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman? He hath promiſed to Believers that <hi>they ſhall tread down the wicked, and that they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of their feet.</hi> Mal. 4. 3. But yet he hath made their warfare to be as long as their life. He hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a glorious reſurrection of their bodies out of the grave: And yet for how many thouſand years have his Saints lain diſſolved in their duſt, as if they did ſeeme to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forgotten by him? Now to what
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115728:153"/> end hath God ſet ſuch long periods of time between the making and the accompliſhing of his promiſes? but only that he would have the heirs of them to live by faith, yea, and to die in faith by reſting on the truth of his Word for the fulfilling of every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which he hath undertaken for in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And indeed this glory which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers give to God in the exerciſe of their faith upon his Word, is farre greater, and more noble then all that glory which the whole univerſe of creatures do yeeld unto him. They give him the glory of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their being, and in the comforts of it derived unto them by him. But who gives him the glory of his faithfulneſſe in his promiſes but a Believer? Who is it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in hope of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. but a Believer? Who glories in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations but a Believer? Who is it that lets not his confidence die when his life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, but a Believer? <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73. 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The life of faith is of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates the <hi>moſt contented, and of all lives the fulleſt of real ſweetneſſe and delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:115728:154"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is the moſt contented life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> True contentment is the inſeparable companion of true faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. A Believer is the onely perſon that is inſtructed in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſtery, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. The things that others want, he deſires not: <hi>Riches</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers covet with the ſtraining of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, he throws away as ſnares: <hi>Pleaſures</hi> which others drink down with a thirſt unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, he out of choiſe ſparingly ſips of, or elſe refuſeth ſo much as to taſte: <hi>Honours</hi> that others value themſelves by, he looks upon as fancies, and not realities. As <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> told the Muſicians, that a Philoſopher could dine and eate his meat without them: So a Believer can live happily without the having of any of theſe things. And the ground of all this is, becauſe by faith he lives above them, and enjoyes more high and noble delights in the very expectation and hope of that bleſſedneſſe which God hath promiſed, then any other can have from the fruition of an earthly Paradiſe, or of the whole world it ſelf, if turned and changed into an <hi>Eden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Of all lives, the life of faith is the ſweeteſt.</hi> The delicacies that faith feeds upon doth not ariſe from any ſtagnant and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115728:154"/> impure pits or ciſterns, but from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and well of life: It ſucks the breaſts of conſolation, <hi>Iſay</hi> 66. 11. It lives upon the free favour of God, which is better then life it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 3. It hath Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for nutriment, whoſe <hi>fleſh is meat indeed, whoſe blood is drink indeed,</hi> John 6. 55. All which are food the world knows not of: it never underſtood their preciouſneſſe, or taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſweetneſſe. There is a greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the repaſts of faith, and the refreſhments of the world, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Phyſick of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> the one giving it in the drug, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as they boaſt) in the quinteſſence, and ſpirits extracted from that flegme and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymatter that deads &amp; allaies their efficacy. All the comforts of faith have in them a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity and ſpiritualneſſe, and need not the help of Artiſts to refine them: Such they are, as that Angels themſelves have neither better nor higher to live upon. How inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then are Believers to their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, while they neglect the living by faith, and gaze rather upon theſe dainties with their eyes, then feed upon them with their mouths? How greatly do they live below themſelves, while they take up with the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115728:155"/> things of this world, and put not forth this divine grace of faith, which can fetch every good thing out of heaven? What diſhonour do they caſt on the precious promiſes while like the luſtful Iſraelites, they ſlight this <hi>Manna</hi> of the Goſpel as dry food? O therefore if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit, if any excellency in the promiſes; be perſwaded you that are the beloved ones of God, to live the life of faith, and to exerciſe it in an improvement of the promiſes, the uſe of which makes you more rich and bleſſed then the having of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to move Believers to act faith upon the promiſes, I ſhall adde this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that their labour and expectation will not be in vaine. Faith in the promiſe is like the bowe of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and the ſword of <hi>Saul,</hi> which never returned empty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 22. It alwayes findes what it ſeeks, and enjoyes what it deſires. <hi>He that beleeveth ſhall never be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6. that is, he ſhall not be diſappointed, or broken in his purpoſes or hopes. If the promiſe be not good ſecurity to reſt and build upon, What is? What bond can be ſo firme as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115728:155"/> his Word, who cannot lie? <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. What pledge can be more certain, then the earneſt of the Spirit, by which the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Believers is ſealed unto them? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1. 14. If theſe foundations fail, then we may well ſay with the Prophet, <hi>What can the righteous do?</hi> But ſooner ſhall the rocks be broken into bits, and thrown as pib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and cockle-ſhels upon the ſhoar by the violence of the waves; ſooner ſhall the mountains that God hath ſet faſt by his ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 6. be over-turned by the breath of tempeſtuous windes, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are founded upon the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power of God, and the never-failing goodneſſe of Chriſt, be in the leaſt <hi>iota</hi> made void, and of no effect. For beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of Gods Word which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirme unto Believers the truth of the promiſes, the goodneſſe alſo and mercy of Chriſt, are as another ſacred anchor for their faith and confidence to reſt upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if in relation to the promiſes, it be ſeriouſly thought on in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the promiſes are <hi>the real pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the precious blood of Chriſt,</hi> and muſt therefore be certainly made good, or elſe he muſt be a loſer in all his ſufferings.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115728:156"/> If he like <hi>Jonathan, 1 Sam.</hi> 18. 4. ſhould ſtrip himſelf not only of his robes, but of his life, that he might expreſſe his love to diſtreſſed and undone perſons, with whom God is angry and diſpleaſed, and yet they receive no advantage or fruit by it; would not all theſe condeſcenſions of goodneſſe and mercy be in vain? If he ſhould drink of that brook and torrent of curſes that was in the way between ſalvation and ſinners, and yet the paſſage to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan</hi> be no more open then it was before, ſhould not Chriſt be a greater loſer then ſinners themſelves? They it is true, loſe their ſoules, each of which are of more value then ſo many worlds; but Chriſt muſt loſe the revenue of his glory, which is farre more precious then the ſouls of all the men in the world. How would ſinne exult and triumph, if it ſhould ever be able to ſay, there was a pardon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted for to be given ſuch a perſon, but I have hindred the execution of it? How would Satan reproach the death of Chriſt, if he could be able to ſay that he hath deſtroyed one ſoul for whom Chriſt died? Yea, how ſhould <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to throw forth their gantlet,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115728:156"/> and to challenge all the enemies of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do their worſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. if any of them could make a ſeparation between the love of Chriſt and them? How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would tribulation, perſecution, famine, nakedneſſe ſay, we will make you miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? How ſoone would perils, and the ſword reply, we will conquer you? How confidently would principalities and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers ſay, we will pluck you out of Chriſts hand? But for ever bleſſed be his Name, there are none among the whole hoſt of enemies that dare revile the confidence of a beleever, or ſay as that uncircumciſed <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 44. <hi>I will give thy fleſh to the fowles of the aire, or to the beaſts of the field.</hi> There are none that dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, that they can make void the leaſt mercy which the promiſe doth hold forth to be the gift of Chriſts love, and the purchaſe of his blood. Let therefore beleevers lift up the hands which hang down, and put forth the ſtrength of faith in renewed acts of confidence upon the promiſes, being fully perſwaded in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this truth, that they can no more be diſappointed of their hopes, then Chriſt can be diſappointed of his purchaſe.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:115728:157"/>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the promiſes are the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the most prevailing interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> who now ſits on the right hand of God in glory. When he was on earth, he purchaſed by the price of his blood, all that maſſe of treaſure, and riches both of grace and glory that are inventoried in the promiſes, and by his laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament on the croſſe bequeathed them to beleevers. But all this which was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted here below, was onely (as Divines uſually terme it) <hi>medium impetrationis,</hi> the meanes of procurement, or obtaining it for beleevers; the <hi>medium applicationis,</hi> the meanes of applying all this unto them, are as his reſurrection, and interceſſion: his reſurrection that declares his conqueſt over death: his interceſſion that ſhews his favour and acceptance with God. And they are both as neceſſary to make his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of force unto beleevers; as the image or ſtamp of the Prince is, to make the coin currant, though it neither adde weight or value to the ſubſtance. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>being made perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Author of eternal ſalvation unto all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt is ſet forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115728:157"/> with all the advantages that may be, that thereby beleevers may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of their intereſt and title to the things which he hath purchaſed. <hi>We have a great high Priest that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Sonne of God, let us therefore hold fast our profeſſion,</hi> Heb. 4. 14. Firſt, <hi>He is a great high Priest,</hi> greater then all that were before him, both in power and favour with God. Secondly, <hi>He is paſſed into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> a Sanctuary which no other Prieſt could ever enter into, or ſit down in, all their ſacrifices being imperfect, and therefore to be daily renewed by them. Thirdly. <hi>He is Jeſus the Sonne of God,</hi> more near in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto him, then Angels or men, and therefore moſt ſure to prevaile for the obtaining of whatever he asks or requires of him. When he therefore who is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Favorite</hi> of heaven is the Believers <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> and doth continually ſolicit God to fulfil his Covenant made with him, and his peoples prayers made unto him; What ground can therebe for jealouſies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt in a Believers heart? What rational impediment can there be imagined, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or weaken the confidence of faith, which the interceſſion of Chriſt doth not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115728:158"/> and take away? Are your prayers tainted with the corruption and infirmities of the fleſh? he perfumes them with the ſweet odours of his interceſſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. Are your ſins multiplyed and renewed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? So are the interceſſions of Chriſt: It is his only work in heaven, to intercede for ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. Are your perſons vile, and ſuch which you fear God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept? Chriſt who is your high Prieſt, <hi>is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmleſſe, and ſeparate from ſinners, Heb.</hi> 7. 26. He hath in his perſon a fulneſſe of all perfections, which may aſſure every Believer, that the promiſes which he pleads, that the requeſts which he makes to God in Chriſts Name, ſhall not be like arrowes ſhot at the Sunne, which never reach it, or come near to it; but that they ſhall pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and be of ſuch power and prevalency with God, as that what they ſeek, he will grant, and the promiſes which they plead in faith, he will performe and make good in truth. Wherefore let me again commend unto Believers, the great duty of exerciſing faith on he promiſes of Chriſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fill the heart with ſtrong and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable conſolations, when by the eye of faith they are looked upon as thoſe great
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115728:158"/> things, which are both the purchaſe of his moſt precious blood, and the matter of his moſt powerful interceſſion.</p>
               <p>And now as Mariners, who when they come nigh the port, roll up their ſails which were before ſpread, they being not uſeful in the harbour, that were before moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the ſea: So muſt I, being arrived at that point which was the utmoſt boundary of my thoughts and intentions, draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a concluſion, and winde up this whole diſcourſe concerning the excellency and the uſe of the promiſes of the Goſpel, which hath hitherto been dilated and inſiſted on in the ſeveral particulars. And yet methinks I had need to wiſh new ſides, new lungs, and an hour new turned up, that I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin all again; or elſe to ſit down, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine with the Prophet, <hi>Iſay 49 4. I have laboured in vaine, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought.</hi> O where are thoſe affectionate expreſſions, acclamations and rejoycings of heart, which I expected would have echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from every mouth, and have appeared in every face, that had heard and been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch glad tydings of peace
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115728:159"/> and mercy, as the promiſes do declare, and teſtifie from heaven towards ſinners? I had thought, that ſome as full of heavenly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration would have ſtood like the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi> with bowed heads, and faces looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mercy-ſeat, as being deſirous to pry and ſearch more into theſe divine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which are the delightful ſtudy of Angels. That others like <hi>Peter</hi> in the mount of transfiguration, having had ſome glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the glory of heaven, would have cried out, <hi>It is good being here.</hi> Or wiſh as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. <hi>O that I might all the dayes of my life behold the beauty of the Lord!</hi> I had thought, that others at the opening of theſe Wells of ſalvation, and a free invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to drink of theſe waters, which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever drinketh of, ſhall never thirſt againe, would like the woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. 15. have ſaid, <hi>Lord, give me this water, that I thirſt not, neither come hither to draw:</hi> That others, at the gathering of this <hi>Manna</hi> which hath been plentifully rained downe upon them, and gives life beyond death, would with moſt ſincere hearts have made that prayer, which the Jewes did in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, <hi>John 6. 34. Lord, evermore give us this bread.</hi> But alas! <hi>Who hath beleeved
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115728:159"/> our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> Methinks ſtill men ſtand altogether unaffected, as if this day ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had not been brought, either to their houſes, or to their hearts; as if nothing had been ſpoken that concerned their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſſe. They are like <hi>Pauls</hi> audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that heard him preach of the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. Some ſcorne, others doubt, and few beleeve. Brethren, from whence is it, (I beſeech you) that there is ſo little change and alteration made either in your countenances or in your affections? Is it becauſe I have ſhewed you the glory, and preciouſneſſe of the promiſes only through a crevice, which you would willingly have beheld with open face? Alas! who is it that can ſee theſe things in their luſtre and live? You can never underſtand their worth, till you come to enjoy them in heaven. Or is it becauſe this treaſure is brought unto you in an earthen veſſel that you ſet ſo low a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon it? God it is, who hath ſo ordered the diſpenſation, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Or do you expect that I ſhould heap up more arguments that might farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the promiſes unto you? O how eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115728:160"/> as well as gladly, could I undertake this taske, if that I might be but ſure to endeare the promiſes to you thereby? <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells of a Citie in <hi>Sicilia</hi> that was called <hi>Triocala,</hi> becauſe it had <hi>ſprings</hi> of water of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſweetneſſe, <hi>Vine-yards</hi> of the choyſeſt wines, and <hi>rocks</hi> of moſt impregnable ſtrength. But how much more truly may the Promiſes of the Goſpel be ſtiled not <hi>Trioca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> but <hi>Pancala,</hi> which are not only as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing well-ſprings of living water, nor as pleaſant Vineyards that abound with wine that makes glad the heart, nor as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable rocks againſt which the gates of hell are never able to prevaile, but are alſo a celeſtial <hi>Eden,</hi> in which (as <hi>Bernard</hi> pithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) there is <hi>totum quod velis, &amp; nihil quod nolis,</hi> every thing that you would deſire, and nothing that you would diſlike. But I may not forget my ſelf, and inſtead of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anchor in the haven, ſpread the canvaſe, and put forth to ſea again. I ſhall therefore ceaſe from ſpeaking to you, and ſhall turne all my expoſtulations with you, into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for you: Beſeeching him who in <hi>Paul's</hi> planting, and <hi>Apollo's</hi> watering doth alone give the increaſe; that he would by the mighty working of his holy Spirit,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115728:160"/> make what hath been ſpoken, to be a word of effectual grace unto you that have heard it, that it may build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified: And that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the ſame bleſſing to all thoſe that by his providence may now read, what others have heard: that ſo his Name to whom alone all is due, may have the whole praiſe and the glory.</p>
